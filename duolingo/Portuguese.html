            How to use definite articles
            <strong>
             o, os, a, as
            </strong>
           </h3>
           <p>
            Definite articles are the equivalent to the English word
            <strong>
             the
            </strong>
            , however, in Portuguese they can vary depending on
            <strong>
             gender
            </strong>
            and
            <strong>

            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Every single object, idea or person in Portuguese is either masculine or feminine, except for very particular cases. The definite article helps you then to determine if the noun is:

             Persons and verb conjugations
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Verbs in Portuguese change depending on who is doing the action. This happens in English when, for instance, "to write" gets conjugated to "he write
            <strong>
             s
            </strong>
            ."
           </p>
           <p>
            In Portuguese, however, verbs have a different conjugation for each grammatical person.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's take verb "to be", for instance. "To be" can translate to "ser" or "estar", but let's keep just "ser" for the basic lessons.

            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Portuguese has differences between the singular and the plural forms of "you". If you address one person only, use the singular form. If you address two or more people, use the plural form. See table below.

             all
            </strong>
            of them. The "tu" and "vÃ³s" versions can be left aside.
           </p>
           <p>
            "VÃ³s" is mostly obsolete and is hardly ever used except in very formal or old texts. "Tu" is quite common in some places (including Portugal,Portuguese-speaking countries in Africa and Asia and the south of Brazil), but it can be replaced by "vocÃª". See (2) below.
           </p>
           <p>
            (2) Both "tu" and "vÃ³s" can be safely replaced by "vocÃª" (singular) and "vocÃªs" (plural). Their conjugations match the respective conjugations for "ele/ela" and "eles/elas".

            One of the most important things about different languages is that they also have different expressions.
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            You will notice sometimes that "word by word" translations can result in sentences that simply don't make any sense.
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember:
            <strong>
             different languages think different!
            </strong>

           </p>
           <p>
            Portuguese does not invert word order or add auxiliary verbs for asking questions, just add the question mark and you are ready to go!

             Plural or singular?
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            In many cases, English does not allow countable nouns to be in singular form without articles. That is not the case in Portuguese. Singular countable nouns with no articles in Portuguese will have a general meaning, similar to an English plural or an English singular with an indefinite article, depending on the context.
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            So, both Portuguese sentences below are just ok:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Ele Ã© cozinheiro = He is a cook
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Ele nÃ£o come ovo = He does not eat eggs
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Their versions with articles or in plural forms are valid as well:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Ele Ã© cozinheiro = Ele Ã© um cozinheiro
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Ele nÃ£o come ovo = Ele nÃ£o come ovos
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Verb for eating
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Aside from idiomatic expressions, the only verb for eating in Portuguese is "comer".
           </p>
           <p>
            The verb "ter" is translated as "to have", but only in the sense of "possess/own/contain":
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             NÃ³s comemos o almoÃ§o = We eat lunch
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             NÃ³s temos almoÃ§o = We have
             <strong>
              got
             </strong>
             lunch
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Here you can start to know a few exceptions on the usage of articles, as in the example above.
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            "Lunch" in English is a noun that doesn't need an article, even in singular. (That is not the normal behavior of most singular countable nouns in English)
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            In these cases, the Portuguese translation normally keeps the article for specific meanings.

           </p>
           <p>
            For drinking, there is the verb "beber".
            <br/>
            It's possible in less formal contexts to also use "tomar".     But tomar only means "to drink" if used with actual drinks. Sentences without the objects will sound strange with "tomar".

             Amargo means bitter: coffee, beer.

            In Portguese, ingredients are not adjectives like in English.
           </p>
           <p>
            To say "orange juice", for instance, it's necessary to add the preposition "de" and then the ingredient:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Orange juice = suco de laranja

            Why is that?? Well....the translations here are definitely not literal. The main purpose of this lesson is not to teach grammar and normal language translations, but to teach how people commonly say things in everyday life.

            Portuguese plurals have one thing in common: virtually
            <strong>
             they all end in -s
            </strong>
            . Sounds easy, right? Not quite.

           <p>
            <strong>
             With words ending in vowels or a diphthong
            </strong>
            , you really just need to
            <strong>
             add -s to the singular

            An important thing about plurals is that all adjectives, articles, possessives and determiners pointing to the noun must be changed by adding the plural ending to them as well, and in accordance to the rules stated here.
           </p>
           <p>
            One example with adjectives, articles and possessives:
            <br/>

            1)
            <strong>

             The trickiest part of learning the plurals comes from words ending in -Ã£o
            </strong>
            . Sometimes they form plurals just by adding -s
            <strong>
             (-Ã£os)
            </strong>
            , but most of them change to
            <strong>
             -Ãµes
            </strong>
            and a small minority to
            <strong>
             -Ã£es
            </strong>
            . Youâll need to memorize the pairs to make sure youâre using the correct plural (but donât worry - thatâs an issue that troubles many native speakers as well):

            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            For example, the word âcorrimÃ£oâ (banister, handrail) saw its etymological correct plural form
            <strong>
             corrimÃ£os
            </strong>
            (since itâs a compound word that ends in âmÃ£oâ, hand, and therefore should have a similar ending) mainly replaced in daily usage by
            <strong>
             corrimÃµes
            </strong>
            (by analogy with the majority of words ending in -Ã£o, which form the plural with -Ãµes).
           </p>
           <p>
            P.S. In words like âcidadÃ£oâ or âcapitÃ£oâ where only one form is established (see above), itâs considered incorrect and in bad taste to use any other plural ending.

            Portuguese regular possessive adjectives and pronouns are somewhat similar to English, but there are some differences. In Portuguese, they follow a few rules.

            Alternative pronouns:

           <p>
            As you may have noticed, without context itâs impossible to discern which third person pronoun (vocÃª/ele/ela/vocÃªs/eles/elas) the regular possessive is referring to. (Normally in these cases Duolingo accepts all possible translations if they make sense):
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Seu cÃ£o = Your / His / Her / Their dog
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            In Brazil, using "seu" in simple sentences most of the times means "your(s)", but in sentences with some context, it tends to refer to the previously stated subject:
            <br/>
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Eu nÃ£o vi
             <strong>
              o seu casaco
             </strong>
             = I didn't see
             <strong>
              your coat
             </strong>
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             A menina vestiu
             <strong>
              seu casaco
             </strong>
             e saiu = The girl put on
             <strong>
              her coat
             </strong>
             and left
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            To avoid that confusion, there are other possessive pronouns whose declinations refer to the owner instead and
            <strong>
             do not decline according to the owned noun

            - A popular informal one referring to "nÃ³s" is "da gente". It's not used in disambiguation, because "nosso(as)" is not ambiguous, but it's common in popular language due to "a gente" meaning "nÃ³s".

            These are nothing but the personal pronoun preceded by a "de" preposition, creating an effect similar to "of him", "of her", "of them", "of yours". But unlike English, they are very natural in Portuguese.

            <strong>
             adjectives

            (coming before nouns) can have
            <strong>
             optional
            </strong>
            articles, the possessive
            <strong>
             pronouns
            </strong>
            (that don't precede nouns) must use the articles consistently.
           </p>
           <p>
            One way of checking whether the article should be used is inverting the English sentence to the unusual "of him" form.
            <br/>
            Then the article should behave in a similar way in both languages. (Please consider that this unusual English form is not commonly accepted as English translations in the system)

             , what is the difference?
            </strong>
           </h4>
           <p>
            In Portuguese, there are two very common ways to refer to "you (singular)":
            <strong>
             tu
            </strong>
            and
            <strong>
             vocÃª
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Both words mean you, but only "tu" is truly a second person pronoun according to grammar. (VocÃª is a treatment pronoun that uses third person conjugations)
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Is one more formal than the other?
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            That will depend a lot on what region we are talking about. Some people see "tu" as an informal thing, others don't.
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            With time, several regions of Brazil chose "vocÃª" as the standard way of saying you. Other regions, however, kept "tu" as the most common form.
           </p>
           <p>
            Examples of places that use "tu" very often are Portugal, Portuguese speaking countries in Asia and Africa and the south of Brazil.

            Conjugations
           </h3>
           <p>
            The verb conjugations for each one are different. While "tu" uses true second person conjugations (the ones you see in tables), "vocÃª" uses third person conjugations (the ones for "ele/ela"):

            </tbody>
           </table>
           <p>
            In speech, it is very common to see people using "tu" with "vocÃª conjugations", but that is not grammatically correct.

            Plural or singular??
           </h3>
           <p>
            <strong>
             The noun "roupa" (clothes) in Portuguese can be either countable or uncountable.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            You can say "roupa" as "clothes in general" as well as "roupas".
            <br/>
            One "roupa" can be the entire set of clothes:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Gosto da tua roupa = I like your clothes
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Gosto das tuas roupas = I like your clothes
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            But "roupa" is not "cloth". For that, there is "pano" or "tecido".
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Clothes coming in pairs
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            For clothes that come in pairs, such as shoes, gloves, boots, it's also possible to use the singular form in Portuguese when referring to the pair:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Ela gosta do meu sapato novo = She likes my new shoes
            </li>
           </ul>
           <h3>
            Why possessive??
           </h3>
           <p>
            One interesting feature in Portuguese is the possibility of using definite articles (o/a/os/as) instead of possessives when it's obvious who something's owner is:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Ele tira
             <strong>
              os
             </strong>
             sapatos = He takes
             <strong>
              his
             </strong>
             shoes off
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            This is common with clothes and body parts, and it's also more natural than using actual possessives.
           </p>

            Verbs for clothes
           </h3>
           <p>
            In Portuguese, there are a few different verbs we use for clothes.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <strong>
              Usar
             </strong>
             - This is the main verb for "wearing" clothes.
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>
              PÃ´r/Colocar/Botar
             </strong>
             - These three have the same meaning: "to put" in general cases and "to put on" for clothes
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>
              Vestir
             </strong>
             - "Vestir" is flexible and can mean either "to wear" or "to put on". But it's more common as "to put on".  --- Notice that "vestir" is an irregular verb for "eu", where it's conjugated as "eu visto".
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>
              CalÃ§ar
             </strong>
             - This one is exclusive for footwear (socks, shoes, slippers, etc.). It also means either "to put on" or "to wear".
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>
              Tirar
             </strong>
             - "Tirar" is the opposite of "botar", it means "to take off". (In other contexts, it can mean "take away, remove", etc.)
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            So, be careful when you see a sentence with "usar + clothes". Although it might mean "to use", it's much more likely to mean "wear" in English:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             She is wearing a blue shirt = Ela estÃ¡ usando/vestindo uma camisa azul
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Put these pants on = Coloque/Vista estas calÃ§as
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Funny thing about clothes in Portuguese

            .
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             "CalÃ§a", besides being a conjugation of the verb "calÃ§ar", also means "trousers/pants".
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             "Bota", besides being a conjugation of "botar", also means "boot".
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            This leads to a common joke:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Por que vocÃª calÃ§a a bota e bota a calÃ§a? = Why do you put on the boot and put on the pants
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            ....well.... it's only funny in Portuguese, I guess XD.

           <p>
            This one is used to ask things that you do understand, but you don't know what/which they are. Sometimes it's "what", sometimes it's "which":
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <strong>
              Qual
             </strong>
             Ã© o seu nome? =
             <strong>
              What
             </strong>
             is your name?
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>
              Qual
             </strong>
             vocÃª quer? =
             <strong>
              Which one
             </strong>
             do you want?
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             NÃ£o sei
             <strong>
              qual
             </strong>
             eu quero. = I don't know
             <strong>
              which one
             </strong>
             I want.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            You don't ask "o que Ã© o seu nome?", that would mean you don't understand what a name is. That would state something near "please explain what your name is".
            <br/>

           </p>
           <p>
            In this case, "que" and "qual" are exactly the same, meaning "what" or "which":
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Que/Qual comida vocÃª quer? = What/Which food do you want?

           <p>
            Question words are usually placed at the beginning of the sentence. But except for the verb "to be", the "subject - verb" order is kept the same as in affirmative sentences:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <strong>

            <li>

             <strong>
              Quantos
             </strong>
             gatos ela tem? (instead of "tem ela")
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>
              How much

              Quanto
             </strong>
             aÃ§Ãºcar vocÃª quer? (instead of "quer vocÃª")
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            The three sentences above are also right the other way around, although the first of the following may sound informal:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Aquilo Ã©

              o quÃª
             </strong>
             ?  ("QuÃª" at the end has "Ãª")
            </li>
            <li>
             Ela tem
             <strong>
              quantos
             </strong>
             gatos?
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             VocÃª quer
             <strong>
              quanto
             </strong>
             aÃ§Ãºcar?
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            <strong>
             But could the word order change?
            </strong>
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            Most of the times it can. But since the inversion is
            <strong>
             not standard
            </strong>
            , it may sound weird. The best thing to do is really to
            <strong>
             keep the same order
            </strong>
            as in affirmative sentences.

           </p>
           <p>
            Let's start looking at the most basic verb tense: the simple present. In Portuguese, this is called "presente do indicativo."
           </p>
           <p>
            Basically, there are three kinds of verbs in Portuguese:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             1st: verbs ending in
             <strong>
              <em>
               ar
              </em>
             </strong>
             - Ex: ajudar = to help
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             2nd: verbs ending in
             <strong>
              <em>
               er
              </em>
             </strong>
             - Ex: beber = to drink
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             3rd: verbs ending in
             <strong>
              <em>
               ir
              </em>
             </strong>
             - Ex: abrir = to open
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Each of these follow a conjugation pattern. So all the regular verbs just get a consistent ending in each case:

           </p>
           <p>
            Irregular verbs are those that don't follow the same conjugation pattern. Their conjugations might or not follow a pattern, and each verb must be learned individually in this case.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some examples: ser (to be), fazer (to do/make), ir (to go), ouvir (to hear/listen) and others.

          <div class="_2f1i5">
           <p>
            Prepositions can be a tough matter for many learners, but don't worry! In every language, prepositions cannot be directly translated.
           </p>
           <p>
            The most important rule for prepositions is:
            <strong>
             They always depend on the rest of the expression to make sense!
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            So, if you intend to memorize preposition translations, remember this:
            <strong>
             this will only work for time and space
            </strong>
            , other cases must be seen as a whole.
            <br/>
           </p>
           <h3>
            Some cases
           </h3>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Some prepositions are demanded by the verbs. They might or not make sense, but the verbs simply ask for them. The best to do here is to just forget about the preposition itself and always remember the pair: verb + preposition.
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Prepositions for places have consistent translations
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Prepositions for time have different, but consistent translations too
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Prepositions for creating subordinate clauses before infinitive verbs have a different behavior
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Certain expressions simply are as they are. All we can do is to accept them.
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            All this might seem very complicated at first, but in time everything gets clearer.

            Contractions
           </h3>
           <p>
            In Portuguese, certain prepositions must be contracted with the following word. It happens to "em", "de", "a" and "por" before articles and pronouns.
           </p>
           <p>
            The good news is: among so many different words, you will see that in fact they are just a few well known words forming many combinations.

             Nouns that change genders
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            You are probably getting used to Portuguese genders by now, but here, we will see some interesting distinctions between two kinds of nouns:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Those that have the gender of the person/animal they refer to
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Those that have genders by themselves
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Among family nouns, animals and professions, it's very common to find those that change genders according to the person they refer to:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Tio / Tia = Uncle / Aunt
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Filho / Filha = Son / Daughter
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             AvÃ´ / AvÃ³ = Grandfather / Grandmother
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             IrmÃ£o / IrmÃ£ = Brother / Sister
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Gato / Gata = Male cat / Female cat
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Engenheiro / Engenheira = Male engineer / Female engineer
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            On the other hand, some of them have always the same gender regardless of the person they refer to:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             CrianÃ§a = Child - Always feminine
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Pessoa = Person - Always feminine
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            .
            <br/>
            <strong>
             Genders and plurals or general statements
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Here we are going to see what to do when we don't know the gender of the people or when there is a group with mixed genders.
           </p>
           <p>
            Portuguese takes the masculine gender as the standard gender for general cases.
            <br/>
            This means that for nouns, adjectives and any other thing that can change genders, one chooses the masculine gender to talk about unknown or mixed genders.
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            Examples of unknown genders:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             There is a cat here = HÃ¡ um gato aqui
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             No one is perfect = NinguÃ©m Ã© perfeito
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            In these examples, the cat can be either male or female: a strange cat we don't know the gender. And the people we are talking about can be just anyone, men and women.
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            If we use the feminine genders, both examples get very specific:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             HÃ¡ uma gata aqui (you know for sure the cat is a female, there is no other option)
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             NinguÃ©m Ã© perfeita (despite being an awkward sentence, this refers to a group containing only women)
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            In plurals, the same rule applies. If you have a group with mixed genders, the chosen gender is masculine:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             (os) IrmÃ£os = (the) Siblings (any gender)
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             (os) IrmÃ£os = (the) Brothers (boys only)
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             (as) IrmÃ£s = (the) Sisters (girls only)
             <br/>

             .

            <strong>
             seems
            </strong>

            "Tamanho" is a general word meaning "size".
            <br/>
            It can be used either for exact measures or general sizes such as "pequeno (small), mÃ©dio (mid-size)" and "grande (big)".

           </p>
           <p>
            Clothes are often labeled with the letters "P, M, G" for their sizes. (PP is smaller than P and GG is bigger than G).
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            "Medida" is attached to numbers, exact measurements:

            "Largo" is a false cognate, and it is not a synonym of big.
            <br/>
            "Largo" is related to "largura" (width), so it's mostly "wide".
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Amplo
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            "Amplo" is used mostly for "rooms", "spaces" and "ranges", when it can mean "wide", but not as an actual width measurement.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Grande
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            "Grande" means "big" or "large" in the most common senses.
            <br/>
           </p>
           <h3>
            Justo x Apertado
           </h3>
           <p>
            Sometimes both seem to mean the same (tight), but mostly they mean:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Justo - Firm, tight, the exact size, with no clearance
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Apertado - Uncomfortably tight, too tight.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            It's true their meanings can overlap a little, but "justo" is not used often for things that have a negative connotation.
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            For machine parts, though, "apertado" and "justo" would mean the same.

             Nouns with two genders
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            As it happens with nouns for people and animals, professions in Portuguese can also change genders depending on the professional's gender.
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            But here, it's very common to see nouns that
            <strong>
             do change genders
            </strong>
            , but
            <strong>
             without changing forms
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            As well as with the other nouns that change genders, in sentences where genders are unknown or mixed, Portuguese adopts the masculine gender, which will only show in articles, adjectives and other determiners for this case.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nouns changing forms:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Engenheiro / Engenheira = Engineer
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Arquiteto / Arquiteta = Architect
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Diretor / Diretora = (school) Principal / Director
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Nouns that don't change forms:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             O artista / A artista = The artist
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             O profissional / A profissional = The professional
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             O gerente / A gerente = The manager
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>

           <ul>
            <li>
             Os artistas em geral sÃ£o mais sentimentais = Artists in general are more sentimental. (Mixed or unknown genders use masculine articles)

           <p>
            In the sizes skill, an interesting difference in how languages view things shows up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just like it happens when telling people's ages, when telling things' sizes, Portuguese uses the verb "ter" instead of translating the verb "to be" directly.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, whenever telling something's measurements, remember that:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             The bar
             <strong>
              is
             </strong>
             fifty centimeters (
             <strong>
              long
             </strong>
             ) = A barra
             <strong>
              tem
             </strong>
             cinquenta centÃ­metros (
             <strong>
              de comprimento
             </strong>
             )
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             You must
             <strong>
              be
             </strong>
             two meters
             <strong>
              tall
             </strong>
             to enter the volleyball team = VocÃª precisa
             <strong>

             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Notice also the preposition "de" used when telling which dimension you are talking about.
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Measurements without verbs
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            When measurements appear directly attached to something without a verb, similar to an adjective, Portuguese sentences use the form "de + size", working the same way food flavors do:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>

            Adjective positioning
           </h3>
           <p>
            Should they come before or after the noun?
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            This question is not so easy to answer. Mostly, adjectives should come after the nouns, but some can only come before nouns, some can only go after nouns, and some can go anywhere, with a slight change in meaning.
            <br/>

             Adjectives that can go anywhere
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            The adjectives that can be placed either before or after the noun can have a slight change in meaning depending on the position.
           </p>
           <p>
            Adjectives after nouns get a very literal meaning, while adjectives before nouns can get a more sentimental meaning:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Um homem grande = A big man (size)
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Um grande homem = A great man
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Uma casa velha = An old house (an aged house, probably showing some problems)
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Uma velha casa = An old house (probably full of stories and feelings, or well known)
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            This is not a strict rule though, intonation might have an influence too and many adjectives wouldn't be able to show any difference in meaning.

            Adverbs are words that modify verbs, adjectives and other adverbs.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are used for adding location, time, intensity, modes and many other things.

            Adverbs don't inflect!

           <p>
            Adverbs are not used to change nouns, and because of it, they don't inflect.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's true they can change inflected adjectives, but even though, they remain uninflected.

            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            "Bem" is an adverb, meaning "well" or, if modifying an adjective, "quite".
            <br/>
            "Bom" is an adjective, meaning "good":

            <br/>

            "Onde" means "where", being a location. But "aonde" is a contraction of "a + onde", being used for movements and destinations. Something like "where to".

            The easiest usage of prepositions is when they are about places. In this case, it's often possible to trust dictionary translations for prepositions.

           <ul>
            <li>
             Current location = Em (no, na) = In / On / At

            "Ser" and "Estar" can be confusing verbs at first, but they follow some rules. Along with them, often there is "ficar", which adds to the confusion.

           </h3>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Ser - To be permanently or in long term, or something related to identity
             <br/>

           <ul>
            <li>
             Ela Ã© linda = She is beautiful (always, it's her nature to be beautiful)

            </li>
            <li>

             <p>

             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Ela fica linda o ano inteiro = She stays beautiful the entire year (the complements and context make a difference, this one uses the general "stay" meaning)
             <br/>

           </ul>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Identity vs State - Ser vs Estar
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Another way of seeing this, specially when referring to people, is the difference between
            <strong>
             identity/personality
            </strong>
            and
            <strong>
             current state
            </strong>
            .
            <br/>
            That explains why, for instance, only "ser" is used for professions. Professions are attached to identity, it's not really seen as a current state, although you can philosophically see it like that.

           <h3>
            For places and locations - static objects (cannot be moved)
           </h3>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Ser - Indicates the location of an unmovable thing.
            </li>
            <li>
             Estar - Hardly used, because unmovable objects doesn't have the transitory meaning.

            <strong>
             Subject and Object pronouns
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            In Portuguese, pronouns also change for subjects and objects.
           </p>
           <p>
            So far you are used to the "pronomes do caso reto" (subjective pronouns), they are used for subjects: "Eu, tu/vocÃª, ele, nÃ³s, vÃ³s/vocÃªs, eles"
           </p>
           <p>
            But when they are objects, they turn into "pronome oblÃ­quo" (objective pronouns). You can compare them like you can compare "he" with "him" and "she" with "her".
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             "He" and "she" are subjective pronouns (pronomes do caso reto) = "ele" and "ela".
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             "Him" and "her" are objective pronouns (pronomes do caso oblÃ­quo) = "o" and "a".
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            In Portuguese,
            <strong>
             o, os, as, a
            </strong>
            , besides being articles, can also be direct object pronouns which are normally used to replace a direct object (a noun, person or thing) in a sentence in order to avoid repetition.
           </p>
           <p>
            This answers, for instance, why
            <em>
             "Eu os ouÃ§o"
            </em>
            is used instead of
            <em>
             "Eu ouÃ§o eles"
            </em>
            . (1 - See note at the end).

            <strong>
             Direct and indirect objects
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            In Portuguese, pronouns also change depending on whether the object is direct or indirect, and when there is a preposition.

             Ind. Obj.

            - Indirect objects are used when the verb needs a preposition, but this version of the pronoun removes the preposition (DÃª-lhe o carro = Give him the car - See below to understand this completely)

            <strong>

            - Reflexive pronouns are used when the subject performs an action towards him or herself. (Ele se cortou = He cut himself / Eu me vi no espelho = I saw myself in the mirror / Tu te cortaste = you have cut yourself)
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             With prep.
            </strong>
            - These are also indirect objects, but the preposition is needed together with the pronoun. (DÃª o carro a mim = Give the car to me). In Brazil, the "si" versions are mostly for reflexive cases with prepositions.
           </p>
           <p>
            (1): The direct object pronoun is normally not used correctly in spoken form, so you would hear a lot more people saying
            <strong>
             Eu ouÃ§o eles
            </strong>
            than
            <strong>
             Eu os ouÃ§o
            </strong>
            . A great number of Brazilian speakers would prefer using "ele/ela/eles/elas" instead.

           </p>
           <p>
            There are some rules that determine whether they should be put in one of these positions. In Brazil, though, these rules are rarely mastered by people, some of them might feel unnatural and even some writers disagree of them. In formal academic writings though, they would be required. In Portugal, they follow these rules more strictly than in Brazil. (Duolingo is not strict about these specific rules)

            Negative words, some adverbs and pronouns attract the clitic pronoun to be placed just after them, before the verb.

            A pronoun that does not use a preposition cannot start a sentence according to the formal rules, but even though, in Brazil this is a very common practice.

            If no "attracting" word is present, pronouns will go after the verb, attached with hyphens.

            If the pronoun is "o, a, os, as", it changes depending on the verb's ending:

            </li>
            <li>
             PegÃ¡-lo (pegar + o) = To take it (verb ending in "r")

           </ul>
           <p>
            When necessary, the accent is added so the verb keep the last syllable stressed after losing the "r":

            This is very rare today, but in formal rules, if you cannot use "prÃ³clise" for verbs in future conjugations, you add the pronoun in the middle of the verb:

            Forming big numbers

           <p>
            In Portuguese, forming big numbers is similar to English, but adding the conjunction "e" between digits and commas after thousands and bigger:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Twenty-one = vinte e um/uma
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Forty-five = quarenta e cinco
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             One hundred and ten (1)(2) = Cento e dez
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             One thousand seven hundred sixty-two  (2) = Mil, setecentos e sessenta e dois (masc.) = Mil, setecentas e sessenta e duas (fem.)
            </li>
            <li>
             Three hundred thousand = Trezentos/trezentas mil
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            (1) "Cento" is used instead of "cem" whenever followed by the rest of the number.
            <br/>
            (2) There is no need to translate the "one/a" in "one/a hundred/thousand". The words "cem", "cento" and "mil" stand alone and contain "one" implied.

           <p>
            There's an interesting distinction about the usage of these words between English and Portuguese.
           </p>
           <p>
            For instance, one cannot say that "algum" is always "some" or that "qualquer" is always "any". In fact they can be just the other way around.
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            So, how to distinguish them?
           </p>
           <p>
            The key is in whether the sentence is negative, affirmative or a question! So, in a simple table, it works like this:
           </p>
           <table>
            <thead>

           <p>
            Here are what you will probably see as a standard meaning for these words:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Algum (affirmative) = some

            </li>
            <li>
             Nenhum (affirmative) = no/none
            </li>
            <li>
             Qualquer (affirmative) = any
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            It might seem weird to say that a sentence with "nenhum" is affirmative, since nenhum itself is a negative word. But since Portuguese often uses double negation with "nenhum", we are putting the ones that are not double negation here.

            But now things change a little. You will notice that in questions they become:

           <ul>
            <li>
             Algum = any

            <li>
             Nenhum = not + any / no
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Qualquer = just any / any
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Wait, all of them mean any in questions? Yes, but:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Algum is used for standard questions
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Nenhum is used as "any" in negative questions
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Qualquer is not often used in questions, but can replace "algum" or keep its standard affirmative meaning.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            See the examples:
           </p>

            <li>
             VocÃª tem

             conselho para mim? = Do you have any advice for me?

            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Rarely, the examples above could use "qualquer", but it might seem unusual.
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            In plural form, "alguns/algumas" can mean "some" too:

            <li>
             Qualquer um serve?? = Does just any one fit? (Among all the possibilities, all of them are good)

            <li>
             Nenhum = not + any / no

           </ul>
           <p>
            Again, for
            <strong>
             nenhum
            </strong>
            , you can choose where to put the negation:
           </p>

            <li>
             NÃ£o tem

             problema = There is
             <strong>
              no
             </strong>
             problem = There are
             <strong>
              n't
             </strong>
             <strong>
              any
             </strong>
             problems.
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            And "qualquer" can less often replace "nenhum", or keep its standard affirmative meaning.
            <br/>
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Eu nÃ£o quero
             <strong>
              qualquer
             </strong>
             professor = I don't want just any teacher (I want a good teacher)
            </li>
            <li>
             NÃ£o tem
             <strong>
              qualquer
             </strong>
             problema = There aren't any problems
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            So, whenever possible, "qualquer" will retain it's "just any" meaning. In order to avoid doubt, prefer "nenhum" when you mean "no".

          <div class="_2f1i5">
           <p>
            Infinitive verbs in Portuguese are just the verbs not conjugated.
           </p>
           <p>
            In Portuguese there is nothing that matches "to" in an infinitive verb.
           </p>
           <p>
            So both "bare infinitive" and "full infinitive" translate the same:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             I want

              ir
             </strong>
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Let's
             <strong>
              try

           <h3>
            Infinitive or gerund?
           </h3>
           <p>
            Although having something called "gerdÃºndio" with verbs ending in "ndo", which we will see in further skills, Portuguese does not have what English calls a "gerund" (Using a verb ending in "ing" as a noun or noun clause).
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            Portuguese verbs ending in "ndo" are used only in progressive tenses.
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            But, if Portuguese doesn't have "gerunds" how are they  translated?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Portuguese uses
             <strong>
              infinitive verbs
             </strong>
             as translations for the English gerunds.

            But mostly, they are not related to the infinitive verbs, but demanded by the other verb instead.

            In Portuguese, there are a few different past tenses. In this lesson, we will see the "pretÃ©rito perfeito".
           </p>
           <p>
            Although the name translates literally to "past perfect", it's not equivalent to this tense. There is a different point of view about tense names.
           </p>
           <p>
            This tense, the
            <strong>
             "pretÃ©rito perfeito"
            </strong>
            , matches mainly the
            <strong>
             "simple past"
            </strong>
            and sometimes the
            <strong>
             "present perfect"
            </strong>
            when it's about a single action concluded in the past.
           </p>
           <p>
            Important: Portuguese doesn't add auxiliary verbs such as "did". So the conjugated form is used in questions and negative sentences too.

            In addition to having tenses showing "when" an action takes place, languages also have
            <strong>
             moods
            </strong>
            , that indicate how the verb is being used. Different moods have different meanings.

            <strong>
             Imperative

            is the verb mood for
            <strong>
             giving orders
            </strong>
            .

             <strong>
              use
             </strong>
             the imperative mood. (See? This "use" is in imperative mood)

           <p>
            (1) - There is no singular first person form (eu), for one cannot give orders to oneself.
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            (2) - Different from others, imperative has different conjugations for affirmative and negative sentences for "tu" and "vÃ³s".
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            Regarding the second person ("you"), they follow the same idea as other conjugations. You can use either "tu" conjugations (2nd person) or "vocÃª" conjugations (3rd person). Depending on where you are, one might sound more formal than the other. In general, "vocÃª" conjugations are more formal, but that may vary.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, since English has only one form of "you" for both singular and plural, most English imperative sentences could be translated with any of the four conjugation options in Portuguese: "tu/vocÃª/vÃ³s/vocÃªs". ("VÃ³s" is quite obsolete here too).
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            Just remember that when you are talking to a single person, you have to use the singular forms (tu/vocÃª). And when talking to more than one person, use (vÃ³s/vocÃªs).
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            Ex:
            <strong>
             Open the door!
            </strong>
            <br/>
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Abre a porta! (tu)
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Abra a porta! (vocÃª)
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Abri a porta! (vÃ³s)
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Abram a porta! (vocÃªs)
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            As you may have noticed or read, all negative forms of the imperative mood are identical to the present subjunctive form. Nevertheless, that does not mean they are the same thing. Imperative mood is used when giving orders, while the subjunctive is required when making uncertain statements. They are two different moods with identical conjugations.

             Future with verb "ir"
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            In Portuguese, the future tense has two possible ways of conjugating. One uses the verb "ir" in present as an auxiliary verb and the other doesn't.
           </p>
           <p>
            Normally, the one with auxiliary verb is closer in meaning to the "going to" future and the other is closer to the "will" future. The simple form is also more formal.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Eu comprarei um terno = I will buy a suit
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Eu vou comprar um terno = I'm going to buy a suit.
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            But that difference is not very clear in Portuguese, so they are used interchangeably. The simple form is more formal, though.

            So, for this lesson, all you need to know is how to conjugate the verb "ir" (to go) in present tense. And to get started, you can see "ir" as "be going to" or "will", just like the English verb structure:

           <p>
            What to do when the main verb is "ir"?
            <br/>
            Can I use "ele vai ir" (he will go)?
           </p>
           <p>
            No, in this case, just use "ir" in present (it will serve both as present and future):
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Ele vai = he will go = he is going to
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Ele vai = he goes

             An informal trend
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Many people commonly replace the present conjugation of "ir" for its future conjugation. That is not considered a correct future tense but it's quite accepted.
           </p>
           <p>
            So when you see "ele irÃ¡ fazer", it means "ele vai fazer" = he will do (it).

            In Portuguese, there are many adjectives for nationalities.
           </p>
           <p>
            As adjectives, they do decline normally regarding gender and numbers:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Um homem francÃªs = A French man
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Homens franceses = French men
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Uma mulher francesa = a French woman
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Mulheres francesas = French women
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Notice that Portuguese
            <strong>
             does not use capital letters
            </strong>
            for these, only for country names:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             O Brasil Ã© dos brasileiros = Brazil belongs to (the) Brazilians. (1)

            </strong>
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            Virtually all of these adjectives can be used as nouns without any change! Just remember these nouns, just like professions, should be inflected as well:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Um alemÃ£o = A German man
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Uma alemÃ£ = A German woman
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Os alemÃ£es = The German people/men (2)
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             As alemÃ£s = The German women
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Even when the English language can use uninflected adjectives referring to plural things, Portuguese will keep the inflections:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             The

            (1) Most country names in Portuguese will require a definite article, but there are exceptions. Each country behaves in a distinct way.

            Ano and sÃ©rie may be used interchangeably depending on where people live. To avoid confusion, people might use more complete sentences:

            <li>
             Um aluno do primeiro ano do ensino mÃ©dio = A student from the first grade of the high school

            Nowadays, "grau" is not used in standard Brazilian education anymore. But before changes, "graus" were used referring to major education levels:

            <li>
             "Primeiro grau" became "ensino fundamental" = elementary and middle school

           <h3>
            Past participle
           </h3>
           <p>
            In Portuguese, when one talks about "participle", it means mostly "past participle", since the idea of "present participle" is not that famous (other names are used for "present participles" in Portuguese).
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            Past participles are used mainly for three things:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Creating
             <strong>
              adjectives
             </strong>
             out of verbs
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Creating sentences in
             <strong>
              passive voice
             </strong>
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Creating
             <strong>
              compound tenses
             </strong>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            In this skill, we are going to see the first two cases.
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            In both of them, the participle must be inflected regarding genders and number. (That is not true for compound tenses though)
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Adjectives
            </strong>
            :
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            Not all past participles suit adjective usages, but when they do, it's as simple as using any other adjective:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Ela estÃ¡ cans
             <strong>
              ada
             </strong>
             = She is tired
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Ela ficou cans
             <strong>
              ada
             </strong>
             = She got tired
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             O carro estÃ¡ par
             <strong>
              ado
             </strong>
             = The car is stopped
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Ele estÃ¡ abat
             <strong>
              ido
             </strong>
             = He is downcast
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             As portas estÃ£o
             <strong>
              abertas
             </strong>
             = The doors are open  ("aberto" is an irregular past participle)
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Passive voice:
            </strong>
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            Passive voices in Portuguese are pretty much like English passive voices:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Just use the verb "ser (to be)" + "past participle"
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            But remember: only "ser" can be used for passive voices.
            <br/>
            Using "estar" + "past participle" will end up creating an adjective telling one's current state. So:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Passive voice: Ser + participle
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Inherent/Permanent quality: Ser + adjective/participle (this is rare with participles)
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Current state: Estar + adjective/participle
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Passive voice examples:
            <br/>

             As portas sÃ£o abertas toda manhÃ£ = The doors are opened every morning.
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             O dinheiro foi roubado = The money was stolen
             <br/>

           <p>
            Some verbs follow irregular patterns, such as:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Fazer - Feito (done/made)
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Ver - Visto (seen)
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Some have both forms:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Pagar - Pago / Pagado (paid)
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Pegar - Pego / Pegado (gotten/caught/taken)
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Ganhar - Ganho / Ganhado (won/earned)
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Acender - Aceso / Acendido (lightened/turned on the light)
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            When they have both forms, the regular form is used for compound tenses and the irregular forms are the ones inflected and used as adjectives and in passive voices. (This last rule has exceptions where the irregular form is the most popular in every case)

            Just like the other nouns, each country has its own gender, and some reject the article. Unfortunately, there is no clear rule for that, except when its name contains an ordinary noun as the main part of it, the article will follow that noun:

            When they are nouns, one is about directions, the other is about law:

           <ul>
            <li>
             Vire

            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Remember that "direita/direito" can also be adjectives, in which case they will inflect normally:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             O lado direito = The right side

           <p>

            <strong>
             Hints:
            </strong>
            - It's natural to use "estar com" as a form of temporary possession in Portuguese. It can be used even with concrete objects: "Estou com seu carro = I have your car (currently, your car is under my possession).
           </p>
           <h3>
            The verb "sentir"
           </h3>
           <p>
            In Portuguese, the verb "sentir" also works a little differently, being a reflexive verb when you feel
            <strong>
             somehow
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Normally, it takes a direct object just like in English:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             I feel the wind = Eu sinto o vento
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             She feels something weird = Ela sente algo estranho
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            But if you feel
            <strong>
             somehow
            </strong>
            , you must use the reflexive form of it:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             I feel weird = Sinto-me estranho
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             She feels happy = Ela sente-se feliz
            </li>
           </ul>

            The past tenses - PretÃ©rito Perfeito Composto
           </h3>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Here is a tricky verb tense.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            This tense will resemble a lot the English present perfect, because it also uses the present tense of the verb "to have" plus the past participle of the main verb.
           </p>
           <p>
            In Portuguese, however, this structure has another name
            <strong>
             and another meaning
            </strong>
            !
           </p>
           <p>
            It's called "pretÃ©rito perfeito composto" (translated literally as: compound preterite perfect).
           </p>
           <p>
            Although using the analogous structure "present ter" + "past participle" of the main verb, its meaning is not the same.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whenever you see this construction, remember it talks about a
            <strong>
             recent repetition
            </strong>
            , things have been repeating *
            <em>
             lately
            </em>
            . So, in general translations are like:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Ele
             <strong>
              tem feito
             </strong>
             os exercÃ­cios regularmente = He
             <strong>
              has been doing
             </strong>
             his exercises regularly
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Meu computador
             <strong>
              tem feito
             </strong>
             barulhos estranhos = My computer
             <strong>
              has been making
             </strong>
             strange noises (lately).
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Ela
             <strong>
              tem comprado
             </strong>
             coisas diferentes = She
             <strong>
              has been buying
             </strong>
             different things (lately)
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            So, the first question you might be asking yourself is...."how do I translate the English present perfect to Portuguese then"?
           </p>
           <p>
            Normally, when it's a
            <strong>
             simple concluded action
            </strong>
            , you do it with the "pretÃ©rito perfeito":
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             I
             <strong>
              have done
             </strong>
             my job = Eu
             <strong>
              fiz
             </strong>
             o meu trabalho
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             She
             <strong>
              has found
             </strong>
             her way home = Ela
             <strong>
              encontrou
             </strong>
             o caminho para casa.
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            But when it's about something that is true
            <strong>
             "since" a certain point in the past
            </strong>
            , then you just use the present tense:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             I
             <strong>
              have lived
             </strong>
             here since I was a kid = Eu
             <strong>
              moro
             </strong>
             aqui desde quando eu era uma crianÃ§a
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             She
             <strong>
              has not drunk
             </strong>
             since the accident = Ela
             <strong>
              nÃ£o bebe
             </strong>
             desde o acidente.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            And finally, the verb
            <strong>
             "to be"
            </strong>
            and some of the so called
            <strong>
             "stative verbs"
            </strong>
            behave differently.
           </p>
           <p>
            They can in many cases be translated word by word:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             I
             <strong>
              have been
             </strong>
             tired = Eu
             <strong>
              tenho estado
             </strong>
             cansado (this is a state that has been repeating lately).
            </li>
            <li>
             She
             <strong>
              has been
             </strong>
             happy = Ela tem estado feliz.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            One possible explanation for that is that you cannot write things like "have been being".
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            <strong>
             So, how to understand all that simply?
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Just remember: Portuguese "ter + past.participle"
            <strong>
             always means a "recent repetition
            </strong>
            ". So, if the English sentence means that, you can translate it with the Portuguese "pretÃ©rito perfeito composto".
           </p>
           <p>
            If the English sentence cannot or does not mean a recent repetition, then the Portuguese tense must be changed to fit the true meaning.

            The past perfect in Portuguese is called
            <strong>
             PretÃ©rito mais-que-perfeito
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Here, we are going to see the
            <strong>
             PretÃ©rito mais-que-perfeito composto
            </strong>
            , meaning it's a compound tense (having an auxiliary verb).
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            The compound version of the tense is the most popular version and its structure and meaning are identical to that of English. (Except that adverbs don't go in between the verbs).
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            The auxiliary verb used is "ter" in "imperfect past":
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             She
             <strong>
              had
             </strong>
             already
             <strong>
              gone
             </strong>
             = Ela jÃ¡
             <strong>
              tinha ido
             </strong>
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             You
             <strong>
              had found
             </strong>
             a treasure = VocÃª
             <strong>
              tinha encontrado
             </strong>
             um tesouro.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Optionally, some people prefer using the verb "haver", there is no difference in meaning, and it might sound more formal:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             As pessoas nÃ£o
             <strong>
              haviam chegado
             </strong>
             = The people
             <strong>
              had
             </strong>
             not
             <strong>
              arrived
             </strong>

            - Notice that conjugations for "eu, ele, ela" and "vocÃª" are the same! For that reason, it's highly recommended that the personal pronoun be explicit,
            <strong>
             even for the "eu" case
            </strong>
            , unless context is very clear! Otherwise, one would not know who is doing the action due to so many possibilities.

            For those who like advanced knowledge, let's talk about the simple version of this tense. This is getting almost forgotten in Portuguese, but can still be seen in some books. (These conjugations are not the scope of this unit)

            <strong>
             Discarding the possessive adjectives??
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            An interesting feature in Portuguese is the fact that one can choose to simply not use the possessive adjective if it's obvious something belongs to someone. One uses the definite article instead.
           </p>
           <p>
            The most common case where it happens is about body parts:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             He hurt
             <strong>
              his
             </strong>
             finger = Ele machucou
             <strong>
              o
             </strong>
             dedo
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             She turned
             <strong>
              her
             </strong>
             head to look = Ela virou
             <strong>
              a
             </strong>
             cabeÃ§a para olhar
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             We can move
             <strong>
              our
             </strong>
             feet = Nos podemos mexer
             <strong>
              os
             </strong>
             pÃ©s
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            But remember: only when it's obvious (something in the sentence states who the owner is). The following sentences would keep the possessive:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             My head hurts = Minha cabeÃ§a dÃ³i
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             His arm is strong = O braÃ§o dele Ã© forte
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            <strong>
             "Doer" or "machucar"?
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            The English verb "to hurt" can have two distinct meanings in Portuguese:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Something hurts another - Machucar
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Something is in pain - Doer
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Examples:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Minhas pernas doem = My legs hurt
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Meus sapatos machucam meus dedos dos pÃ©s = My shoes hurt my toes

            In English, gerunds and present participles use the "ing" ending on the verbs.

           </p>

            Present participle
           </h3>
           <p>
            The present participle is the continuous action of the verb, the continuous tense. In Portuguese, it's called "gerÃºndio". The translations are mostly straight and clear, using the verb "estar".
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             He is eating = Ele estÃ¡ comendo
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             The teacher is talking = O professor estÃ¡ falando.

            <strong>
             "estar a + infinitive"
            </strong>
            is also a form of progressive tense, being more common in European Portuguese.

           </p>
           <p>
            In English, some verbs are static, meaning they cannot be used in the progressive form. They are verbs such as "like", "believe", "want" and others. But Portuguese doesn't have those kind of verbs, so you will find some sentences whose translations are not so straight:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Eu estou gostando disso = I like this (not "I'm liking")
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Ela estÃ¡ querendo mais = She wants more (not "she is wanting")

           <p>
            Is there a difference in the meaning between "Eu estou gostando" and "Eu gosto"??
            <br/>
            Well....a little, when using the progressive form, you really mean you are "enjoying" something that is currently taking place, while the simple present form can be used in general.

            Gerunds
           </h3>
           <p>
            Now, Gerunds in English create "nouns" and "noun clauses" using the "ing" verb ending. In Portuguese, a gerund such as this doesn't exist!!! You use the infinitive verb instead:

           <h3>
            Futuro do presente composto
           </h3>
           <p>
            In Portuguese, the equivalent tense to "Future Perfect" is called "Futuro do presente composto" (literally "compound future of the present").
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            This tense is used to say that something will have been or will have happened.
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            The construction is similar to English, taking future "ter" (will have) and the past participle of the main verb:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             When we finish the course, we
             <strong>
              will have learned
             </strong>
             a lot.
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Quando terminarmos o curso, nÃ³s
             <strong>
              teremos aprendido

             muito.
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            So, all you have to do is to understand "ter" future conjugations and pay attention to some irregular past participle endings:

            Futuro do subjuntivo

           <p>
            Often, this skill's tense is associated with the future subjunctive, just as in the previous example: "quando terminarmos".
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            For that reason, some of the sentences in this skill contain future subjunctive verbs.  (1)
           </p>
           <p>
            Future subjunctive is often used with "se" or "quando", to express the idea that something might not come to be:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <strong>
              Se for verdade

             = Believe it if you want to

            The Subjunctive mood
           </h3>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Introduction
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            In Portuguese, there is a mood dedicated to uncertain statements.
This mood often confuses English speakers because English barely has this feature.
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            Even though, English contains subjunctive moods, but they are often ignored or have the same form as the indicative mood.
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            It's more common to see subjunctive in past in English, especially in "if" sentences:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             If I
             <strong>
              were
             </strong>
             you... (this differs from the indicative "was", but other verbs would seem just like the simple past)
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Here, we are going to see the
            <strong>
             present subjunctive
            </strong>
            , which can be found in sentences such as:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             I suggest that he go = Eu sugiro que ele vÃ¡
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <h3>
            The present subjunctive
           </h3>
           <p>
            Portuguese uses the present subjunctive in much more cases than English.
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            Typical usages of the subjunctive come after certain verbs that express a "possible" result, but not necessarily certain, and also after some conditional keywords.
            <br/>
            Mostly, if other keywords are not present, the present subjunctive conjugations will come after "que". You will also notice that conjugation tables for this tense shows conjugations preceded by "que".

             </strong>
             melhorar = I believe things will get better
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Ela
             <em>
              deseja
             </em>
             <strong>
              que
             </strong>
             tudo
             <strong>
              acabe
             </strong>
             bem = She hopes everything ends well.
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Sometimes, the subjunctive mood is also used for commands/suggestions when these commands are given through another verb. In some of these cases, English behaves the same way:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <em>
              Queremos
             </em>
             <strong>
              que ela fique
             </strong>
             por mais tempo = We want her to stay for longer
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             <em>
              Ordeno
             </em>
             <strong>
              que
             </strong>
             os prisioneiros
             <strong>
              sejam
             </strong>
             libertados = I command
             <strong>
              that
             </strong>
             the prisoners
             <strong>

            <li>
             Eles
             <em>
              pedem
             </em>
             <strong>

             <strong>

             </strong>
             a tempestade passar = I suggest
             <strong>

            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Because of this, and also because conjugations are the same, many people confuse subjunctive and imperative moods.

            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            In many cases, these keywords are either conditional keywords or words that state something that has effect onto the present, or that talks about an expected result:

            This lesson is about a particular tense, known in Portuguese as "Futuro do PretÃ©rito" (future of the past).
           </p>
           <p>
            It gives the verb a meaning that is in most cases equal to that of the auxiliary verb "would". So it's used in conditionals.
           </p>
           <p>
            The regular conjugations are quite easy, for they don't change the infinitive part of the verb, they only add an extra ending.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here they go:

            Curiosity: there is an informal version of these conditionals using the imperfect past:

           <ul>
            <li>
             Se eu tivesse dinheiro, eu viajaria/viajava ao redor do mundo

             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            But these may not make sense if the phrase does not contain both parts of the conditional. So, it should be avoided in simple sentences like just "eu estava em apuros agora". (It would mean "I was in trouble right now").

            Modal verbs in Portuguese work just as they do in English.

           <p>
            They take the conjugations and come before an infinitive verb. The only difference is that they have several conjugations in Portuguese, just like any other verb.
           </p>
           <p>
            Conjugations in Portuguese should follow their normal meanings, such as:

            This conditional form uses "ter" in "Futuro do pretÃ©rito" tense + the main verb in past participle.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's for things that "would have been":

            Also, this conjugation is often used for a specific kind of conditional, which works like the English counterpart.
In the "if" clause, the subjunctive tense is used:

            There is also the possibility of an informal version using imperfect past, but it may not work if the phrase doesn't contain both clauses:

           <p>
            If the sentence is just a plain sentence without the "if clause", listeners will probably assume the standard imperfect past meaning.

            The Past Subjunctive
           </h3>
           <p>
            The past subjunctive talks about actions in the past that are uncertain and also about hypothetical things in general.
           </p>
           <p>
            In English, you can find past subjunctive in "if clauses":
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             If
             <strong>
              I were you
             </strong>
             , I would stay here = Se
             <strong>
              eu fosse
             </strong>
             vocÃª, eu ficaria aqui
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            The conditions for using the past subjunctive are very similar to those for using the present subjunctive. There is just a difference in tenses.
           </p>
           <p>
            But here, a very important case comes into play: the conditionals!
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Conditionals with "if"
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the most important usages of the past subjunctive is for creating conditionals. You will notice also that the "if" keyword (se) is present in conjugation tables.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <strong>
              Se eu fosse
             </strong>
             rico,
             <strong>
              compraria
             </strong>
             um barco = If I were rich, I'd buy a boat
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             NÃ³s
             <strong>
              irÃ­amos
             </strong>
             Ã  praia
             <strong>
              se nÃ£o estivesse
             </strong>
             chovendo = We would go to the beach if it weren't raining
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>
              Se eles gostassem
             </strong>
             de biscoitos, eu lhes
             <strong>
              daria
             </strong>
             uma caixa = If they liked cookies, I'd give them a box
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Optionally, there is the informal possibility of using the imperfect past in the main clause:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Se eu fosse rico,
             <strong>
              <em>
               comprava
              </em>
             </strong>
             um barco
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>

             if
            </strong>
            "; allowing us to create the most common conditionals. (Note that "if" is present in the conjugation tables for past subjunctive)

            PretÃ©rito imperfeito
           </h3>
           <p>
            "Imperfect"? What does it mean?
           </p>
           <p>
            Originally, the term "perfect" was used for "completed" actions, although today some "perfect" tenses don't really follow this strictly.
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            On the other hand, "imperfect" isn't about "conclusions".
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            In Portuguese, the imperfect past talks about something that "was true" or "was happening"
            <strong>
             during
            </strong>
            a certain time period in the past.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's great for continuous actions in the past, habits and steady states creating contexts: things that "were being", if you allow us to use a "non-standard" English.
            <br/>
            While the "pretÃ©rito perfeito" (the one you've studied so far) is great for "changing" something from an unconcluded to a concluded state.
            <br/>

             Continuous meanings
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            In many cases, this tense has a continuous meaning, especially when the "while" idea is present:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Eu
             <strong>
              cozinhava
             </strong>
             enquanto ela
             <strong>
              tomava
             </strong>
             banho = I was cooking while she was showering.
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Ele
             <strong>
              comia
             </strong>
             enquanto
             <strong>
              esperava
             </strong>
             o trem = He was eating while he waited (was waiting) for the train
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            .
            <br/>
            <strong>
             Old habits
            </strong>
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            Since old habits are things that used to happen, spread along a time period, the "imperfect" tense is also the right form for this:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Ele
             <strong>
              escrevia
             </strong>
             livros antes de se mudar = He used to write books before he moved
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             Ela
             <strong>
              tinha
             </strong>
             muitos gatos na sua primeira casa = She had (used to have) many cats in her first house
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            But is "used to" really the right translation? Well, it's an adaptation to convey the right meaning, since simple past can often be interpreted differently.
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            The literal translation of "used to" is "costumava" (and its conjugations for other persons)
            <br/>
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             I used to swim a lot = Eu costumava nadar bastante
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             We used to ride bikes = NÃ³s costumÃ¡vamos andar de bicicleta
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            When "used to" is a good option, "would" can also be a good one. But never with a standard conditional meaning.
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            .
            <br/>
            <strong>
             Setting the scenery in past
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Because scenery is something that is just there, not changing anything, not acting nor completing actions, "imperfect past" is also the best choice to describe it. The scenery "was just being" while the story happened.
            <br/>
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>

             alegremente = The mountains were white, covered in snow, and the trees were all green, the birds sang (were singing) happily.
             <br/>
            </li>

            One interesting rule for simple actions is: if you can use English's present
            <strong>
             perfect
            </strong>
            , then also use Portuguese's "pretÃ©rito
            <strong>
             perfeito
            </strong>
            ".

           <p>
            "Interesse" is a false friend in a business/economic context.
           </p>
           <p>
            In Portuguese, this word is not used as an amount of money one pays as interest. It means only "something one is interested in".
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            For money interests, the word used is "juros", used almost always in plural:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             O banco cobra juros pelos emprÃ©stimos = The bank charges interests for the loans.

           </p>
           <p>
            "FÃ¡brica" is another false friend. In Portuguese, it means "factory" (a place that produces goods).
           </p>
           <p>
            For "fabric (material)", use "tecido" instead.
           </p>
           <ul>

            PretÃ©rito mais-que-perfeito do subjuntivo
           </h3>
           <p>
            Following rules similar to the other subjunctive mood tenses, here comes the "pretÃ©rito mais-que-perfeito", which is for things that happened before another event in the past. (Or, in the subjunctive case, had the possibility of happening, or was a hypothetical occurrence, etc.)
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            This tense is formed with the past subjunctive of "ter" plus the main verb in past participle. In many cases, this will match the English form "had happened". (Optionally, "haver" can be used instead)
            <br/>

             Conditionals with "if"
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            The conditionals with this tense can have two types of main clauses:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             The ones that would have happened in the past, using "teria(...) + past participle"
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             The ones that would apply generally and to the present, using "futuro do pretÃ©rito".
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Examples:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <strong>
              Se eu tivesse chegado
             </strong>
             mais cedo, ela
             <strong>
              nÃ£o teria ficado
             </strong>
             brava = If
             <strong>
              I had arrived
             </strong>
             earlier, she
             <strong>
              would not have gotten
             </strong>
             upset
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             NÃ³s
             <strong>
              terÃ­amos ido
             </strong>
             Ã  praia
             <strong>
              se nÃ£o tivesse chovido
             </strong>
             naquele dia = We
             <strong>
              would have gone
             </strong>
             to the beach if it
             <strong>
              had not rained
             </strong>
             that day
             <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>
              Se eles tivessem comprado
             </strong>
             nossos biscoitos, hoje
             <strong>
              estarÃ­amos
             </strong>
             ricos = If
             <strong>
              they had bought
             </strong>
             our cookies, today
             <strong>
              we would be
             </strong>
             rich
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Here, all examples talk about hypothetical situations in the past. The first two, talks about the hypothetical results in the past while the third one talks about the hypothetical result in present.
            <br/>
           </p>
           <p>
            As the other "futuro do pretÃ©rito" conditionals, there is also the informal possibility of using the imperfect past in the main clause:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Se eu tivesse chegado mais cedo, ela nÃ£o
             <strong>
              tinha
             </strong>
             ficado brava
             <br/>
            </li>
           </ul>

            .

            Examples of verbs expressing "hope/doubt/belief" in past:

           <p>
            Here too, some keywords will ask for the past subjunctive just like they do in present tense. But now, a very important keyword comes into play: "
            <strong>
             if
            </strong>
            "; allowing us to create the most common conditionals. (Note that "if" is present in the conjugation tables for past subjunctive)

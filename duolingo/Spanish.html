            Masculine and Feminine Nouns
           </h5>
           <p>
            In Spanish all nouns are masculine or feminine. Usually, nouns that end with an "o" are masculine, and nouns that end with an "a" are feminine. For example, "manzana" (apple) is feminine and "diario" (newspaper) is masculine.
           </p>
           <p>
            The articles "el" and "un" are used with masculine nouns, and the articles "la" and "una" are used with feminine nouns. "The apple" is "la manzana" and "a newspaper" is "un diario."
           </p>
           <h5>
            Accent Marks
           </h5>
           <p>
            Vowels in Spanish can have an accent mark, such as the "u" in "menú" (menu). One use of the accent mark is to indicate which syllable should be stressed in the pronunciation. For example, in "teléfono" (telephone), the second "e" has the most stress.
           </p>
           <p>
            Accent marks are also used to distinguish homophones. For example, "él" and "el" are homophones because they have the same pronunciation. However, "él" is a masculine pronoun (meaning "he" or "him") and "el" is a masculine article (meaning "the").
           </p>
           <h5>
            The Second Person Singular
           </h5>
           <p>
            "Tú," "usted" and "vos" are different ways of referring to the second person singular (you). "Usted" is the formal way of saying "you," and "vos" is used in informal speech in certain countries instead of "tú."
           </p>
           <p>
            The three pronouns are synonyms, but they change the way verbs are conjugated. For instance, for the verb "comer" (to eat), it is "tú comes," "usted come," and "vos comés."
           </p>
           <p>
            The decision of which form of "you" to use is regional and cultural, but you can typically use "usted" when referring to strangers.
           </p>
           <h5>
            Verb Conjugation
           </h5>
           <p>
            Verb conjugation in Spanish is more complicated than in English. In Spanish, the verb endings change in order to describe who is doing the action and when. For example, for "comer," "I eat" is "yo como" and "you eat" is "tú comes."
           </p>
           <p>
            Because the conjugations indicate who is doing the action, it is usually possible to omit the pronoun. For instance instead of saying "yo como arroz" (I eat rice), you can say "como arroz."

            Tardes and Noches
           </h5>
           <p>
            In English, "afternoon" comes before "evening," which in turn comes before "night." In Spanish there are only two words that cover these times of the day: "tarde" which means "afternoon," but overlaps with "evening," and "noche," which means "night" but also overlaps with "evening." Therefore, at 6:30pm it is ok to say either "buenas tardes" or "buenas noches."

            Buenos Días

           <p>
            Even though "buenos días" literally means "good days," it is used in the mornings to mean "good morning."

            In Spanish, the most common negative word is "no". As an adverb negating a sentence, it always comes immediately before the verb.

            Adjectives.
As a general rule, in Spanish adjectives come after the noun they describe, e.g.
           </p>
           <p>
            An English dog /  Un perro inglés
           </p>

            "El gato es mío" means "The cat is mine."
           </p>
           <p>
            Note that the possessive adjectives vary by number and gender. The change is with the nouns they modify, not with the person(s) who possess the object. For example, for a male cat you say "El gato es tuyo" (The cat is yours) regardless of whether you are talking to a man or a woman.
           </p>
           <p>
            The short form and long forms of nuestro and vuestro and related pronouns are identical. They differ only as to whether they are used before or after the noun.

            Tu Versus Tú

           <p>
            The two words "tu" and "tú" are pronounced the same. "Tú" is the personal pronoun meaning "you" (informal), and "tu" is the possessive adjective meaning "your" (informal).

            The Upside Down Question Mark
           </h5>
           <p>
            In written Spanish, questions should always start with an upside down question mark (¿). For example, to ask “What are you eating?” you would write “¿Qué comes?”
           </p>
           <h5>
            Position of Personal Pronouns
           </h5>
           <p>
            When asking a question, it is possible to place the personal pronoun in different places without affecting the meaning. For example “¿Qué comes tú?” and “¿Tú qué comes?” mean the same thing (and also the same thing as “¿Qué comes?”).
           </p>
           <p>
            The position of the personal pronoun is sometimes used for emphasis. For example “Tú qué comes” places the emphasis on “you” and would mean something like “You, what are you eating?”
           </p>
           <h5>
            “Por qué” versus “Porque”
           </h5>
           <p>
            Even native speakers sometimes confuse “por qué” and “porque,” because they sound exactly the same. However, “por qué” means “why” and “porque” means “because.” That is, “por qué” is typically used when asking a question and “porque” is used when answering it.

            In Spanish, the verb endings change in order to describe who is doing the action and when. Most verbs are "regular," meaning they change their endings in predictable ways.

            Sí Versus Si
           </h5>
           <p>
            Although "sí" and "si" sound the same, "sí" (with an accent mark) means "yes" and "si" means "if."

           <h5>

           <p>
            The word for "and" in Spanish is "y," and the word for "or" is "o." However, if the word after "and" starts with an "i" or "hi" (which sounds the same as "i" because the "h" in Spanish is always silent), then you need to use "e" instead of "y." For example "sons and daughters" is "hijos e hijas." Similarly, if the word after "or" starts with "o" or "ho," then you have to use "u" instead of "o." For example, "dog or bear" is "perro u oso."

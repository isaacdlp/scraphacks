            <em>
             We'll start with some simple sentences right away. Russian does not have articles, nor does it normally use the verb “to be” in the Present tense.
            </em>
           </p>
           <h6>
            An em-dash is used instead of "the verb “to be” between the two nouns: «Мокка — кофе» ("A mocha is coffee").
           </h6>
           <p>
            Russian uses a version of the Cyrillic Alphabet. Many letters look similar to their Latin counterparts. As Cyrillic typography was remodeled around 300 years ago, both alphabets have a similar style.

            <strong>
             А
            </strong>
            sound similar to their Latin counterparts (to be more precise, "о" is the sound in "more"). However, in handwriting and typed italics, the letter
            <strong>
             Т
            </strong>
            can look rather like a lower case 'm' in the Latin alphabet. E.g. in the verb
            <em>
             просить
            </em>
            (to ask for, to request),
            <em>
             т
            </em>
            = t.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Е
            </strong>
            actually sounds more like "ye", as in "yell", not as in "Hear ye, hear ye!" (this will work for now; it's more complicated after a consonant).
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             В
            </strong>
            sounds like 'v',
            <strong>
             Б
            </strong>
            sounds like 'b'.
            <strong>
             Н
            </strong>
            is "n" and

             А
            </strong>
            (it comes from the Greek Λ). Д and Л have a similar top in many fonts, though it's up to the designer. Handwritten
            <strong>
             Д

            <strong>

            P.S. In our notes, we use an accute accent to show you the stress (e.g., ра́дио). It is a standard practice in Russian textbooks for little children or foreign learners—and, generally, the most common way of marking the position of the stress.

           <h3>
            Welcome to our course!
           </h3>
           <p>
            Now you are ready to proceed to the main part of the tree!
           </p>
           <p>
            We are happy that you have chosen our Russian course. Just to make it clear, we are using American English in this course—but don't worry, we will accept all versions of English where appropriate. Just be careful around expressions like "bathroom" or "1st floor", because these may mean different things than what you are used to.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for Russian, we teach the standard language, which is based on the variation spoken around Moscow and Saint Petersburg, and we stick to the usage typical of these cities. Do not worry, though: for more than one reason Russian is rather uniform over the territory of Russian (still, there is some variation in pronunciation and a few items of everyday vocabulary). We try to stay neutral in style, with occasional trips into formal and informal language.
           </p>
           <h3>
            Cases and word order
           </h3>
           <p>
            Russian is an inflected language, so the forms of nouns and modifying adjectives correspond to their role in the sentence.
           </p>
           <p>
            These forms are called
            <strong>
             cases
            </strong>
            . Russian has 6 cases: Nominative, Accusative, Genitive, Prepositional, Dative and Instrumental. The Nominative is the dictionary form; as for the others, we are going to cover them gradually, one by one.
           </p>
           <p>
            This allows for a more loose word order. But not random! A typical word order is
            <em>
             subject—verb—object
            </em>
            . “Old” information (the things you tell
            <em>
             about
            </em>
            ) is normally closer to the beginning of the sentence which is probably why pronouns are often found closer to the beginning of a sentence than a noun would be :
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <em>
              I know him.
             </em>
             → Я
             <strong>
              его́
             </strong>
             зна́ю.
            </li>
            <li>
             <em>
              I know Maria.
             </em>
             → Я зна́ю
             <strong>
              Мари́ю
             </strong>
             .
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            That includes words like “here”, “in this way”, “then” and so on.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unlike English, adverbs are NOT universally grouped at the end. So pay attention to the typical positions for the expressions of time, place and manner. Eg. “very much” is typically in the end-position in English, but in Russian it is just before the thing that is "very" or “very much”:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <em>
              She likes to read
              <strong>
               very much
              </strong>
             </em>
             = Она́
             <strong>
              о́чень
             </strong>
             лю́бит чита́ть
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Good luck!
           </p>
           <h3>
            Vowel reduction
           </h3>
           <p>
            Like in English, vowel letters aren't
            <em>
             all
            </em>
            pronounced just like in the alphabet. In Russian, unstressed syllables have vowels
            <em>
             reduced
            </em>
            :
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <strong>
              А and О
             </strong>
             become the same uh-sound
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>
              И and Е
             </strong>
             (Э) become the same sound similar to "i" in "hit"
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>
              Я
             </strong>
             actually becomes an i-like sound, not an uh-like (except in a few words). This also affects "а" after ч,ш,щ,ж or ц in many words (sadly, not all).
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            So, when a vowel is not stressed, it becomes weaker, somewhat shorter, and also some vowels become indistinguishable.
           </p>
           <p>
            The unstressed syllable is strongest just before the stress. In all other places it is even weaker than that (though, some long words, especially compounds, may acquire a secondary stress). This makes the system different from the English one, where stronger and weaker syllables tend to alternate.
           </p>
           <h3>
            More on the case system
           </h3>
           <p>
            For now, we only study simple sentences that either use the dictionary form, the
            <em>
             Nominative
            </em>
            case, or use the
            <em>
             Accusative
            </em>
            (direct object of an action), which has the same form for many classes of nouns.
           </p>
           <p>
            The case is defined by its use. Nevertheless, these forms have names, usually calques from Latin that reflect some typical use (but not the only one):
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Nominative (subject)
            </li>
            <li>
             Accusative (direct object)
            </li>
            <li>
             Genitive ("of" something)
            </li>
            <li>
             Prepositional (place or topic)
            </li>
            <li>
             Dative (recipient, "indirect" object)
            </li>
            <li>
             Instrumental (means of action)
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            As you can see, these names are of little use until you know what sentence, verb or preposition requires that you use that particular form.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             some nouns of foreign origin are
             <em>
              indeclinable
             </em>
             , i.e. all their forms are the same. This includes words like метро, Дженни or кафе.

            Hello
           </h3>
           <p>
            Russian has a more informal greeting
            <strong>
             «Приве́т»
            </strong>
            and a more formal

             «Здра́вствуй(те)»
            </strong>
            . Here, we focus on the first, since it is the shorter one.
           </p>

           <p>

             «Пожа́луйста»
            </strong>
            (please) has another popular position in the sentence—namely, after the verb (more on that later).

           <h3>
            How are you?
           </h3>
           <p>
            The phrase for "How are you?" literally means "How are your affairs (the stuff you do)?"
           </p>
           <p>
            No one uses it as a greeting, i.e. you are not expected to use it with people you barely know (or those you know, for that matter). And be prepared for a person to
            <em>
             actually
            </em>
            tell you how they've been doing. ;)
           </p>
           <h3>
            Good morning!
           </h3>
           <p>
            Morning typically starts at 4 or 5 a.m., afternoon at noon, evening at 5 p.m. (at 6 for some) and night at 11 or at midnight.
           </p>
           <p>
            You only use "Good night" (Споко́йной но́чи) when parting before sleep (or saying your goodbyes really late, so it is implied you or the listener are going to bed soon after).
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             If you are advanced enough to have noticed oblique forms used in some phrases—you are right! Greetings and other similar expressions are often shortened versions of longer phrases, where words still retain their forms. For example,
            </em>
            «Споко́йной но́чи»
            <em>
             probably replaces the longer

            English prefers to express ownership and “possession” with the verb “have”. In Russian “existence” is almost universally used instead (in the official/academic style «иметь»
            <em>
             to have

             existence
            </em>
            of the object is obvious or not the point — very typical for describing traits or a number of objects (“Tom has a beautiful smile/large eyes”, “She has a very fat cat”). This also applies to expressing temporary states and illnesses (“She has a migraine”).

           <p>
            In English, the only way a verb changes in the present tense is that you add -s for the 3rd person singular. In Russian, all 6 forms are different and fit two regular patterns.
           </p>
           <p>
            However,
            <strong>
             <em>
              eat
             </em>
            </strong>
            «есть» and
            <strong>
             <em>
              want
             </em>
            </strong>
            «хоте́ть» are two of the four verbs that are irregular (that is, do not strictly follow any of the 2 patterns).
           </p>
           <p>
            Note that the "present" tense is formed from one stem and the "past" and infinitive from the second one. In general, these two are slightly different. For now, don't worry about the infinitive stem.
           </p>
           <h3>
            Hard and soft
           </h3>
           <p>
            Russian consonants are split into two groups of 15, which are pronounced in two different ways,
            <em>
             palatalized
            </em>
            (aka "soft") and
            <em>
             non-palatalized
            </em>
            (aka "hard"). We'll stick to the shorter "soft" and "hard" (sorry).
           </p>
           <p>
            When a consonant is "soft" it means than you pronounce it with you tongue raised high; for "non-palatalized" consonants it stays low. Russian orthography has its history but, long story short, you can tell the "softness" of a consonant from a vowel letter spelled afterwards:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <strong>
              А, Ы, У, Э, О
             </strong>
             follow "hard" consonants
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>
              Я, И, Ю, Е, Ё
             </strong>
             follow palatalized ones
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            If there is nothing after a consonant, the soft sign Ь is used to show the softness. In consonant clusters palatalization is predictable from the softness of the last consonant. We aren't teaching it here. These days the trend is to only "soften" the last consonant in most clusters, while a hundred years ago some clusters were palatalized even without any obvious reason.
           </p>
           <p>
            To show you how it works, here is an example, using an ad-hoc transcription:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             же́
             <strong>
              нщ
             </strong>
             ина = [жэнʲщиᵉна]
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>
              ст
             </strong>
             ена́ = [стʲиᵉна] or [сʲтʲиᵉна]
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            There are dictionaries («орфоэпический словарь») that show the recommended pronunciation of words and contain general pronunciation rules, too.
           </p>
           <h3>
            Voicing
           </h3>
           <p>
            Some consonants let your voice come out immediately (voiced) while others wait for the release of the consonant and only then let your voice escape (unvoiced). In Russian there are 6 pairs of such consonants: Б/П, В/Ф, Г/К, Д/Т, Ж/Ш, З/С.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             whenever one of these consonants (except В) follows another, the second overrides or reverses the voicing of the first: сд = [зд], вс= [фс]
            </li>
            <li>
             the end of the phrase is unvoiced: этот клуб
             <em>
              [клуп]
             </em>
            </li>
            <li>
             rules apply between the word boundaries, too
            </li>
            <li>
             Х, Ч, Ц, Щ also play this game, even though Russian lacks letters for their voiced partners ([ɣ], [дж'], [дз], [ж'ж']). They will devoice the preceding consonant or become voiced themselves.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <h6>
            Unlike Ukrainian, Russian only uses [ɣ], [дж'] and [дз] as voiced variants of х, ч, ц. Ukrainian has them as full-fledged consonants—the ones that are an intrinsic part of a word and can appear anywhere.

            Russian makes a distinction between
            <strong>
             ты
            </strong>
            , singular "you", and

             вы
            </strong>
            , plural "you" (y'all). The latter also doubles for "polite" you, with verbs also in plural. And don't forget that the "excuse" in "Excuse me" is a verb!
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>

           <h6>
            Contrary to what many native speakers have come to believe in the last ten or fifteen years, the polite "you" is not automatically capitalized in Russian, and never was. Such capitalization is used in some formal styles.

            Grandson, son of Grand
           </h3>
           <p>
            As you might know if you ever read any Russian literature, Russians have three names; their first name and their surname—just like you have—and a
            <em>
             patronymic
            </em>
            (отчество), which is based on their father's name (отец = father). A very common 'polite' pattern is to use a person's first name and a patronymic:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Ива́н Иванович, вы за́няты? =
             <em>
              Ivan Ivanovich, are you busy?
             </em>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            In this course,
            <strong>
             name+patronymic
            </strong>
            are always used with the polite
            <strong>
             вы
            </strong>
            -form.
           </p>
           <h3>
            What is your name?
           </h3>
           <p>
            «Как вас зову́т?» is literally "How (do) they call you?"
           </p>
           <p>
            Russian has a casual diminutive form for many common names, : Ива̓н→Ва́ня, Мари́я→Маша, Алекса́ндр(Алекса́ндра)→Са́ша, Евге́ний(Евге́ния)→Же́ня, Еле́на→Ле́на, Алексе́й→Лёша, Пётр→Пе́тя. Needless to say, there's no "politeness" with these, but they are often used with some degree of affection.
           </p>
           <h3>
            Excuse me...
           </h3>
           <p>
            Russian has two very common polite patterns for questions that English does not:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <strong>
              negative
             </strong>
             questions give a shade of "by any chance": «Извини́те, вы не зна́ете Михаи́ла?» =
             <em>
              Excuse me, do you happen to know Mikhail?
             </em>
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>
              "Please tell"
             </strong>
             when asking for information: «Скажи́те, пожа́луйста, где музе́й?» =
             <em>
              Excuse me, where is the museum?
             </em>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <h3>
            Thank you
           </h3>
           <p>
            «Спаси́бо»  is the word. A fancier option would be «Благодарю́!» (a form of the verb «благодари́ть», "to thank"), though quite a number of people use it, if only for variety.

            Spelling Rules
           </h3>
           <p>
            Or maybe not. Sometimes Russian forces your choice of vowel to spell or pronounce after a certain letter.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             The 7-letter rule
            </strong>
            : Whenever you make any form of a word, and you need to write И or Ы, check this:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             after К, Г, Х  and Ш, Ж, Щ, Ч always use
             <strong>
              И
             </strong>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            These are velars ("back" consonants) and hushes. For hushes, it is merely a spelling convention, owing to their former "soft" status. For velars, it is true to their pronunciation — i.e., these consonants always use the palatalized И where another consonant would use Ы:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             страна́ → стра́ны
            </li>
            <li>
             строка́ → стро́ки
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Of these seven consonants, «К» should be your main concern for now. A lot of nouns have it as a suffix or a part of their suffix, forcing you to remember this rule.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             The 8-letter rule
            </strong>
            : Whenever you make any form of a word, and you need to write А, У or Я, Ю after a consonant, follow the rule:
           </p>
           <ul>

            Russian words take different forms depending on their role in the sentence. These forms are called
            <strong>
             cases
            </strong>
            . A few forms may look the same (cf. "frequent rains" vs. "It rains often").
           </p>
           <p>
            These forms have names (mostly calques from Latin) that describe some "prototypal" use of such case: Nominative, Accusative, Genitive, Prepositional, Dative and Instrumental. For you, these are just tags: the use is what defines a case.
           </p>
           <p>
            As of now, you know the NOMINATIVE case: the dictionary form of a word. This form acts as the
            <em>
             grammatical subject
            </em>
            of the sentence, the "doer". It is also used for both nouns in "A is B" structure:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Мой па́па ест.
            </li>
            <li>
             Том — мой брат.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            You also know a few Genitive forms (у
            <strong>
             меня
            </strong>
            ) but that's it. For now, we will tackle something easier.
           </p>
           <h3>
            Prepositional case
           </h3>
           <p>
            When we talk about things
            <strong>
             <em>
              being
             </em>
            </strong>
            somewhere, we typically use
            <strong>
             в
            </strong>
            (in) or
            <strong>
             на
            </strong>
            (on) with the Prepositional form of the noun. It doesn't work when you mean
            <em>
             motion
            </em>
            to that place!
           </p>
           <p>
            The Prepositional case (a.k.a. Locative) is the only case that is
            <em>
             never
            </em>
            used on its own without a preposition, even though only four or five prepositions ever use it:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Я на конце́рте. = I am at a concert.
            </li>
            <li>
             Я в шко́ле. = I am at (in) school.
            </li>
            <li>
             ви́део о шко́ле = a video about school
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Unlike English (“at/in school”), in Russian each "place" is associated with just one preposition. The rough overall rule is: use “в”(in, at) when talking about buildings and places with certain boundaries and use “на” (on, at) when talking about open spaces or events:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             в до́ме
             <em>
              (at home)
             </em>
             , в шко́ле
             <em>
              (at school)
             </em>
             , в ко́мнате
             <em>
              (in the room)
             </em>
             , в теа́тре
             <em>
              (in the theater)
             </em>
             , в кино́
             <em>
              (at the cinema)
             </em>
             , в университе́те
             <em>
              (at the university)
             </em>
            </li>
            <li>
             на ули́це
             <em>
              (in the street, outdoors)
             </em>
             , на пло́щади
             <em>
              (at the square)
             </em>
             , на конце́рте
             <em>
              (at the concert)
             </em>
             , на уро́ке
             <em>
              (at the lesson)
             </em>
             , на кора́бле
             <em>
              (on a ship)
             </em>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            When you mean physically being inside/on top of some object, there is little ambiguity. "Places", unfortunately, require memorization.

            Here is the rule that covers most nouns:

             nouns ending in -ия, -ий or -ие also take
             <strong>
              -и
             </strong>
             (so that they end in -ии instead)
            </li>
            <li>
             all other nouns take
             <strong>

             туале́т

            . In this course, we stick to the North American "bathroom", even though a room with a bath is, technically ва́нная (it has ва́нна, "a bath"). Still, in Russian you would not ask for a "bath-room" unless you really mean it.

            "Spelling rules"
           </h3>
           <p>
            Note how plurals of «соба́ка» and «ко́шка» end in И: соба́ки, ко́шки, even though you might expect А to turn into Ы.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are some restrictions on which consonants are used with which vowels when making word forms. Here are the rules for
            <strong>
             и, а, у
            </strong>
            vs.
            <strong>
             ы, я, ю

              ж, ш, щ, ч

            <em>
             К, Г, Х

            are called velar consonants (i.e. made in the back) and
            <em>
             Ш, Щ, Ж, Ч
            </em>
            are often called
            <em>
             hushes
            </em>
            . The latter do not show palatalized/non-palatalized pairs in modern Russian, so the spelling rule does not affect pronunciation anyhow. It's just a convention.

            Fleeting vowels
           </h3>
           <p>
            It is not too important for you at the moment, but you may notice how О and Е sometimes appear in consonant clusters or disappear from them. For example:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Э́то лев. = This is a lion.
            </li>
            <li>
             В зоопа́рке нет льва́. = There isn't a lion at the zoo.

           <hr/>
           <p>
            <em>
             Later you will encounter the Genitive plural (often used with numbers and words like "many" or "few"), which shows a simple pattern for
             <strong>

            <em>
             As you can see, the vowel (О or Е) depends on whether the previous consonant is palatalized or not. Hushes behave as if they were palatalzed, despite Ж and Ш having lost this quality in the modern language.

            A huge number of prepositions requires this case. Yes, «у меня есть», «У неё есть» only use «меня» and «неё» because «у» wants Genitive.

            Indeclinable nouns
           </h3>
           <p>
            A little side note: some nouns of foreign origin are indeclinable. It means that all their forms are the same. Foreign nouns that end in о/е become like that (кофе, метро, радио, резюме), as well as all nouns that do not fit into Russian declension patterns (see above).
           </p>
           <p>
            This includes female names that end in anything other than А or Я. A few
            <strong>
             -ь
            </strong>
            -ending names are an exception (Любовь and Biblical names like Юдифь).
           </p>
           <p>
            So, all of the following names are automatically indeclinable: Маргарет, Мэри, Элли, Дженни, Рэйчел, Натали, Энн, Ким, Тесс, Жасмин.
           </p>
           <h3>
            I am away
           </h3>
           <p>
            Russian also uses the Genitive to state that someone is "away", "not there":
            <em>
             Мамы сейчас нет
            </em>
            . In English such use would correspond to "There is no mom at the moment", or even "There is no me now". We are not hard on that particular construction in the course, but it is important to know it all the same.
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             Added bonus: when a verb directly acts on a noun, the noun is called

            <strong>
             <em>
              a direct object

            </strong>
            <em>
             and is in Accusative. In Russian, only -а/-я feminine nouns have a unique form for it. Others just reuse Genitive or don't change the word at all (Nominative)

           <h3>
            Nothing
           </h3>
           <p>
            Russian uses.... let's call it "consistent" negation. It means that in negative sentences you are
            <em>
             required
            </em>
            to use "nothing" instead of "anything", "nowhere" instead of "somewhere" and so on. Let's meet the first of these pronouns:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             У меня
             <strong>
              ничего
             </strong>
             нет. = I don't have anything.
            </li>
            <li>
             Она
             <strong>
              ничего
             </strong>
             не ест. = She doesn't eat anything.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            You'll also notice that, unlike standard English, Russian has no rule against using double negatives.

            are feminine. Also, you can learn the common suffixes ending in a soft sign that produce a word of a predictable gender. They are:
           </h6>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <strong>

             → feminine
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>
              -тель, -арь, -ырь
             </strong>

           <h6>
            <em>
             All nouns with

              -чь, щь, -шь, -жь
             </strong>
             at the end are feminine. The convention is to spell feminine nouns with a soft sign and masculine ones without one: нож, луч, муж, душ. It doesn't affect pronunciation, anyway.
            </em>

          <div class="_2f1i5">
           <p>
            As you know, the Genitive case has
            <em>
             lots
            </em>
            of uses in Russian.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of them expresses
            <strong>
             an amount
            </strong>
            of something:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             чашка чая = a cup of tea
            </li>
            <li>
             тарелка риса = a plate of rice
            </li>
            <li>
             корзина яблок = a basket of apples
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            With mass nouns it is also used to express "some" unspecified amount of that stuff when used instead of the Accusative:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Я хочу воды = I want (some) water.
            </li>
            <li>
             Дайте, пожалуйста, риса. = Could I have some rice, please? (literally, "Give me, please, some rice").
            </li>
            <li>
             Хочешь сока? = Want some juice?
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Note that this usage is only characteristic for situations when you ask or hypothesize about using "some or other amount" of a substance. You cannot actually say that you are drinking "воды" right now—but you can say that you want some (or that you sipped some in the past—with a perfective¹, of course).
           </p>
           <h3>
            чашка чаю
           </h3>
           <p>
            «Чай» has an alternative Partitive form «чаю»:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Хочешь чашечку чаю? = Want cup of tea?
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            It is optional. Actually, many short masculine nouns that denote substances used to have such form. However, «чай» is, probably, the only one where the form is immensely popular in spoken speech and does not sound old-fashioned or downright archaic.
           </p>
           <h3>
            стакан
           </h3>
           <p>
            Russian differentiates between a number of drinking vessels.
            <strong>
             Стака́н
            </strong>
            is what you call a "glass" in English: typically, a cylindrical vessel made of glass, with no handle. However, if you mean a measurement unit (quite popular in cooking), it corresponds to the English word "cup". In Russian you use do not a cup or rice or flour: you use a "glass" of rice or flour.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             a beer or a wine glass is «бока́л»
            </li>
            <li>
             a smaller wine glass is «рю́мка»
            </li>
           </ul>
           <hr/>
           <h6>
            ¹ Perfective is an
            <em>
             aspect
            </em>
            . Russian has verbs of two flavors: those that denote "processes" and those that mean "events" (events are never used in the present). I would argue that aspect is the main culprit for consumption verbs here. You can want "воды" forever, but you aren't
            <em>
             "drinking"
            </em>
            it at any specific moment. Semantically, "some" water only becomes a real amount when you are done, not while you are still at it.

            Until now, you've been using the base form of the word in sentence like «Он ест

            Actually, whenever a verb, like "read", "cut" or "want" acts

            </em>
            on some noun, the latter is a
            <em>
             direct object
            </em>
            . Such nouns take the Accusative case.

             -я

            have a separate form. «Мама» is a good example of this class :
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             ма́ма → ма́м

            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Neuter nouns and feminine nouns with a final
            <strong>
             -ь
            </strong>
            (e.g., «мы́шь») use the Nominative form.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now we are left with masculine nouns ending in a consonant (сок, медве́дь, брат). They use the same form as in Nominative or Genitive:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             living beings ("animate") copy the Genitive
            </li>
            <li>
             objects  ("inanimate") stay Nominative
            </li>
            <li>
             in plural this rule applies to all types of nouns
            </li>
           </ul>

            Verbs that take a direct object are called

             transitive
            </em>
            . Unfortunately, some verbs that are transitive in Russian are not transitive in English ("wait") and vice versa ("like").

            Russian has two main verb form patterns, which we are going to introduce soon. Unfortunately, the verb «хоте́ть»(to want) is irregular and mixes both. On a brighter note, it is a very common verb, so you'll memorize it eventually.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other notable thing is that it does not have a strong connotation of 'need', unlike the English verb '"want". Similarly, the Russian verb for "give"(да́ть) is totally OK for polite requests. Just use it with «пожа́луйста».

            <li>
             <em>
              the one the 'giving' is directed towards is NOT a direct object in Russian. It is called an indirect object and takes the Dative. We'll deal with it later.

            We will learn these one by one. There are only
            <strong>
             four
            </strong>
            stems with irregular conjugation. The verbs
            <em>
             хоте́ть, дать, есть, бежа́ть
            </em>
            and all their derivatives follow neither the Е- nor the И-conjugation exactly.
           </p>
           <p>
            Note that if the endings are stressed, Ё replaces Е. Fortunately, a non-past form has only 2 options:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             fixed stress – on the stem (чита́ю, чита́ете, ви́жу, ви́дит) or on the ending  (стою́, стои́т, стои́шь)
            </li>
            <li>
             "я"-form has a stressed ending (Я пишу́). The stress falls on the stem everywhere else (ты пи́шешь, она пи́шет..)
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            <em>
             A verb uses one stem to form Infinitive and Past tense forms. It uses the 2nd one, similar, for the non-past forms and the imperative. So you cannot predict all forms from the infinitive. You can make a good guess, though.

           <h3>
            I like/I love ?
           </h3>
           <p>
            In Russian, you can express liking things and activities pretty much the same way as in English, with similar verbs. The usage differs a bit, though.
           </p>
           <p>
            A a rule of thumb,
            <strong>
             «Я люблю́»
            </strong>
            means
            <em>
             "I love"
            </em>
            only when directed at a single person (or animal). Otherwise, it's just "I like".
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             "LOVE"
             <strong>
              люби́ть
             </strong>
             means a stable, lasting feeling (note the phonetic change for the 1st person singular: "люблю"). A normal, transitive verb, i.e. used with the Accusative. Use it for
             <strong>
              <em>
               loving
              </em>
             </strong>
             an individual or
             <em>
              liking some things/people/activity in general
             </em>
             (verbs take infinitive). Very much preferred in negations of such activities (i.e. "don't like to wait")
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              "LIKE"
              <strong>
               нра́виться
              </strong>
              means moderate "liking" something or someone, often something specific. Not transitive! The thing liked is the subject, acting indirectly on a person: «Мне нра́вится стол» =
              <em>
               I like the table.
              </em>
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              note that «Мне нра́вится стол» works in a similar way to the English verb "to seem":
              <em>
               "The table seems good to me"
              </em>
              . The sentence is built as though the table "transmits" the feeling towards you. While rare in English, in Russian, this is pretty typical for feelings and experience to be expressed that way («Мне хорошо́»).
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <h6>
            Infinitive «нра́виться» and 3rd person singular «нра́вится» are pronounced exactly the same, however, for the sake of consistency they are spelt differently (most infinitives end in «-ть», so -ть + ся = -ться, naturally)
           </h6>
           <p>
            When you refer to generic things and activities, both verbs can be used but «люби́ть» is mildly more useful.
           </p>
           <h3>
            May I?
           </h3>
           <p>
            Possibility and/or permission are often expressed with words
            <strong>
             мо́жно
            </strong>
            and
            <strong>
             нельзя́
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Здесь мо́жно жить. = One may live here.
            </li>
            <li>
             Здесь нельзя́ есть. = One cannot/should not eat here.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            The English translation may vary. You can specify the person for whom the permission or recommendation applies, in the Dative (but you do not have to):
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Мне нельзя́ спать. = I should not sleep.
            </li>
            <li>
             Нам нельзя́ мно́го есть. = We should not eat a lot.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            P.S.  the
            <strong>
             -ся
            </strong>
            at the end of "нра́вится" is a reflexive particle and comes after the ending (in verbs, use
            <em>
             -сь
            </em>
            after a vowel,
            <em>
             -ся
            </em>
            after a consonant) . Technically, a reflexive verb is one where the subject of the verb acts on itself. As you can see, often this is not always reflected clearly in the meaning. «Нра́виться» is one of those verbs that are reflexive "just because".
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't worry about it too much for now, as we'll be tackling reflexives in more detail further down the tree.

              is a word for different containers used for cooking , consuming and further storage of food.  English, sadly, does not have the exact equivalent. However, it is obviously "dishes" that you wash and "cookware/tableware" that you buy.

            In this skill, we used
            <em>
             perfective
            </em>
            verbs for "cook", "cut", "wash". The reason is simple: that's the verb you'd use when you want a
            <em>
             single specific
            </em>
            action, often with a result—rather than referring to "activity" (activity may be fun but, in some cases, pointless).

            In Russian,
            <strong>
             и
            </strong>
            is used to show similarity. Otherwise you should use
            <strong>
             а
            </strong>
            , which shows
            <em>
             contrast
            </em>
            . To be more specific, here are the typical patterns:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Я мальчик, а ты девочка. = I am a boy and you are a girl.
            </li>
            <li>
             Я работаю в кафе, а ты в школе. = I work in a cafe, and you (work) in a school.
            </li>
            <li>
             Я люблю спать, а ты нет. = I like sleeping, and you don't.
            </li>
            <li>
             А ты? = And you? → often used to indicate a question.

            )
           </h3>
           <p>
            A conjunction used for "compensating" for something unpleasant with something that, you imply, is good:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             У нас нет молока, зато есть хлеб =
             <em>
              We don't have milk but we do have bread
             </em>
             .
            </li>
            <li>
             Мальчик ещё не умеет писать, зато хорошо читает. =
             <em>
              The boy cannot write yet but he reads well
             </em>
             .
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Not exactly the best thing to translate into English (
            <em>
             "on the other hand"? "but at least"? "thankfully?"
            </em>
            ), so it is not often used in this course.
           </p>
           <h3>
            хотя ('though')
           </h3>
           <p>
            Much like the English
            <em>
             though/even though/although
            </em>
            . It is often combined with "и" before the predicate (which is sometimes directly after «хотя»):
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Он здесь, хотя (он) и не знает ничего.= Он здесь, хотя (он) ничего и не знает. = He is here, even though he doesn't know anything.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <h3>
            как
           </h3>
           <p>
            This conjunction has a rather interesting use, to show when someone perceives someone else's action:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Я ви́жу, как она́ танцу́ет. = I see her dancing.
            </li>
            <li>
             Они́ слу́шают, как музыка́нт игра́ет. = They listen to the musician playing.

             <strong>
              а
             </strong>
             , there is also "narrative" contrast pattern, largely absent from this course (but not from real-life Russian):
            </em>
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             На столе чашка, а в чашке чай. =
             <em>
              There is a cup on the table, and the cup has tea in it
             </em>
             .
            </li>
            <li>
             Он здесь, а это значит — воды нет. =
             <em>
              He is here, and that means there's no water
             </em>
             .
            </li>
            <li>
             Такси — это машина, а машины не всегда хорошо работают. =
             <em>
              A taxi is a car, and cars do not always work well.
             </em>
             (here, you are making your point by introducing a new thought "unexpected" by a listener)

           <p>
            To say "there is/are" in Russian, do the following:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             say THE PLACE
            </li>
            <li>
             then the verb (if any)
            </li>
            <li>
             then THE OBJECT
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            «есть» is not used, unless the sentence really has to emphasize the existence of the object.  Some examples:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             На столе́ ло́жка. = There is a spoon on the table.
            </li>
            <li>
             На сту́ле ма́льчик. = There is a boy on the chair.
            </li>
            <li>
             В до́ме никого́ нет. = There is no one in the house.
            </li>
            <li>
             На столе́ лежи́т ко́шка. = A cat is lying on the table.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            In the Present tense no verb is necessary; in the past, you would at least need a form of "to be". Note that even in the present Russian still uses verbs like "is situated", "stands", "lies" way more often than would be considered normal in English.
           </p>
           <p>
            The most natural translation into English is a structure like "There is an apple on the table" or "An apple is on the table". The emphasis is on the object, not on the place.
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             Actually, such a sentence answers the question of WHAT is in the said place. For out-of-the-blue sentences about objects that have nothing unique about them it matches what English THERE-IS sentences are for. So this is what we have in this course.
            </em>
           </p>
           <h3>
            Actions
           </h3>
           <p>
            The initial position of a "place" inside the sentence holds for many other structures, too. Whenever the place is not a part of the "message" of your sentence, it is usually somewhere at the beginning (that is, if the place frames your description of an action rather than providing crucial information).
           </p>
           <p>
            If the whole point of uttering a sentence is telling someone about the place then, naturally, it takes the sentence-final position:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             За́втра я в Нью-Йо́рке. = I am in New York tomorrow. (not somewhere else)
            </li>
           </ul>
           <h3>
            lies/stands
           </h3>
           <p>
            You don't have to translate verbs like "to stand" and "to lie" literally when they refer to objects. Such use is not, by a wide margin, nearly as standard in English as it is in Russian:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             На столе́ стои́т ча́шка. =
             <em>
              A cup is ("stands") on the table.
             </em>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            In English "to be" is perfectly fine, so we accept that.

             from
            </em>

            <li>
             Где? = Where (at)?

            What or what are you?

            Russian uses
            <strong>
             «Кто»
            </strong>
            (who) when asking about identity and occupation and «Что» is used for objects rather than people. Since Russian nouns have cases,
            <strong>
             кто
            </strong>
            and
            <strong>
             что
            </strong>
            also change depending on their role in the implied sentence. As you will discover a little bit further down the tree, «Кто» behaves rather like a masculine adjective.

            In a few regions of Russia (Tatarstan, for example)  people may use
            <em>
             зачем
            </em>
            for both questions if their  usage of Russian is influenced by a major local language that makes no distinction between the two. In Standard Russian these are two clearly separate entities.

           <p>
            To express the idea of speaking some language, or something being written in that language, Russian has adverbs literally meaning "Russian-ly", "English-ly" etc.. :
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Я не говорю́ по-ру́сски. = I do not speak Russian.
            </li>
            <li>
             Вы говори́те по-англи́йски. = Do you speak English?
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            They are formed from
            <strong>
             -ский
            </strong>
            adjectives by attaching
            <strong>
             по-
            </strong>
            and changing the tail to bare
            <strong>
             -ски
            </strong>
            : по-ру́сски, по-италья́нски, по-япо́нски, по-вьетна́мски, по-америка́нски, по-францу́зски and so on.
           </p>
           <p>
            And remember, these words actually mean something done "in a certain way", so «суши по-американски» (American-style sushi) should not surprise you!

            Locative 2
           </h3>
           <p>
            A relatively small group of short masculine nouns have an accented
            <strong>
             -у
            </strong>
            ending with
            <em>
             в/на
            </em>
            in the meaning of place (and only then):
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Мы в
             <strong>
              аэропорту́
             </strong>
             . = We are at the airport.
            </li>
            <li>
             Я сплю́ на
             <strong>
              полу́
             </strong>
             . = I sleep on the floor.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Our course has about a dozen of them (there are about 100 in the language). Also, there exists a very small group of feminine nouns, all "-ь"-ending, that have a stressed Locative-2 ending:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Твой сви́тер в
             <strong>
              крови́
             </strong>
             . = Your sweater is covered in blood.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            All these nouns use their normal Prepositional form with "о" and "при".
           </p>
           <h4>
            совсе́м
           </h4>
           <p>
            This word is used with qualities that manifest "totally"— usually with negatives:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Он совсе́м не рабо́тает. = He doesn't work at all.
            </li>
            <li>
             Том совсе́м не ест. = Tom doesn't eat at all.
            </li>
            <li>
             Мы совсе́м бли́зко. = We are really close (i.e. almost there).
            </li>
           </ul>
           <h4>
            междунаро́дный
           </h4>
           <p>
            It comes from «ме́жду» + «наро́ды», i.e. "between"+"peoples", which is quite literally "international".
           </p>
           <p>
            The loanword «интернациональный» means the same but has quite limited use in certain combinations like "international team" or "international debt" (mostly these are from political contexts). This course largely avoids this word.
           </p>
           <p>
            Probably, "international team/orchestra" etc. is the context where you must use «интернациональный»).
           </p>
           <h4>
            живо́тное
           </h4>
           <p>
            The word for an "animal" is a nominalised neuter adjective, and its case forms follow adjectival pattern. Of course, its gender is fixed:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Это живо́тные. = These are animals.
            </li>
            <li>
             Я люблю́ живо́тных. = I like animals.

            Russian distinguishes between "going" on foot and by some sort of vehicle. If you aren't moving within the city, use a 'vehicle verb'
            <strong>
             ехать
            </strong>
            (one-way movement) or
            <strong>
             ездить
            </strong>
            (repeated, round trip or in general). More on that later, in "Motion verbs".

            In Russian it is typical to describe objects as "standing", "lying", "being situated", "hanging". This is rare in English, and often sounds unnatural, therefore in this course it is perfectly OK to translate a "whereabouts"-verb with a simple "is", "was" etc.

            Here and there, and here

            <strong>
             Тут
            </strong>
            is considered a bit more informal, and is used in set expressions ( тут же~right away, тут и там). «Здесь» is somewhat less suitable for figurative meanings (when by "here" you mean the current situation rather than a place). In this course, they are completely interchangeable when not being used in a set expression.

           <p>
            <strong>
             находиться

            is a verb to denote the whereabouts of things, and, sometimes of people (when the emphasis is on exactly where they are). It could be translated as "to be situated" or "to be located", but as these verbs usually sound rather formal in English, so you can just use "to be".

             около

            is almost the same as «возле». It can also be used in the sense of "about"(=approximately).

           <p>
            In other words, when using
            <em>
             про́сит
            </em>
            , one wants to be given something (or for something to be done). He who
            <em>
             спра́шивает
            </em>
            –wants an answer.
           </p>
           <p>
            By the way, "to ask a question" is, actually, «
            <em>
             зада́ть/задава́ть
            </em>
            вопро́с». Those who speak German may recall
            <em>
             eine Frage stellen
            </em>
            , which works in a similar way (apparently, "to ask an asking" is no good in German, either).

            Negative sentences
           </h3>
           <p>
            Remember that Russian sort of uses double and triple negatives. To be more precise, it is coordinated negation: when the sentence is negative, you should automatically negate every pronoun referring to
            <em>
             someone
            </em>
            ,
            <em>
             anywhere
            </em>
            ,
            <em>
             some time
            </em>
            ,
            <em>
             anything
            </em>
            ,
            <em>
             in some way
            </em>
            and so on:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Мы никогда́ нику́да ни с кем не ходи́м = We never go anywhere with anyone (Literally, "We never to nowhere with nobody don't go").
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            They all change to
            <em>
             nobody, nowhere, never, nothing, by no means
            </em>
            and so on.
            <em>
             No one
            </em>
            and
            <em>
             nothing
            </em>
            will have the correct case (though, "nothing" is virtually always
            <em>
             ничего
            </em>
            , not
            <em>
             ничто

            The typical position for
            <strong>
             -о
            </strong>
            (-е)-ending adverbs is
            <em>
             before
            </em>
            the verb. For example:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             «Он хорошо́ види́т»="He sees well".
            </li>
            <li>
             «Том бы́стро ушёл»="Tom left quickly"

            Consonant mutation.
           </h3>
           <p>
            You might have noticed that the consonant before the ending is sometimes different in the infinitive than in the personal forms. It is called
            <em>
             mutation
            </em>
            and is quite similar to the process that makes  "tense" into "tension" (where an "s" turns into a "sh"). Here are the patterns you might encounter:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Б, П, В, Ф, М adding
             <strong>
              л
             </strong>
             (люби́ть / люблю́)
            </li>
            <li>
             С, Х becoming
             <strong>
              ш
             </strong>
             (писа́ть / пишу́)
            </li>
            <li>
             Д, З  becoming
             <strong>
              ж
             </strong>
             (ви́деть / ви́жу)
            </li>
            <li>
             Т, К becoming
             <strong>
              ч
             </strong>
             (плати́ть / плачу́)
            </li>
            <li>
             СК, СТ becoming Щ (пусти́ть / пущу́)
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            If there is alteration, there is a rule:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <strong>
              И-conjugation verbs
             </strong>
             only have 1st person singular mutated. It is normal (e.g. люблю / любит)
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>
              Е-conjugation verbs
             </strong>
             have mutation in ALL personal forms (if any). It is
             <em>
              non-productive behaviour
             </em>
             , which in practice means that a lot of popular verb stems still have this behavior (e.g. писать, сказать). However, new Е-conjugation verbs  do not get this pattern.
            </li>
           </ul>

            рисовать → рисую, on the other hand, is a regular transformation of -овать/-евать verbs

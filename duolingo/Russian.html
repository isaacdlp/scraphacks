              We'll start with some simple sentences right away. Russian does not have articles, nor
                                    does it normally use the verb “to be” in the Present tense.
             </em>
            </p>
            <h6>
             An em-dash is used instead of "the verb “to be” between the two nouns: «Мокка — кофе» ("A mocha is
                                        coffee").
            </h6>
            <p>
             Russian uses a version of the Cyrillic Alphabet. Many letters look similar to their Latin counterparts. As
                                        Cyrillic typography was remodeled around 300 years ago, both alphabets have a similar style.

             sound
                                        similar to their Latin counterparts (to be more precise, "о" is the sound in "more"). However, in
                                        handwriting and typed italics, the letter
             <strong>
              Т
             </strong>
             can look rather like a lower case 'm' in the
                                        Latin alphabet. E.g. in the verb
             <em>
              просить
             </em>
             (to ask for, to request),
             <em>

             <strong>
              Е
             </strong>
             actually sounds more like "ye", as in "yell", not as in "Hear ye, hear ye!" (this will
                                        work for now; it's more complicated after a consonant).

              has no equivalent in English. It is an "eeh"-like sound, but less distinct, sounds
                                            closer to "e" in "lover", and has your tongue deeper that in "heat" or "hit".

             P.S. In our notes, we use an accute accent to show you the stress (e.g., ра́дио). It is a standard practice
                                        in Russian textbooks for little children or foreign learners—and, generally, the most common way of marking
                                        the position of the stress.

             Welcome to our course!
            </h3>
            <p>
             Now you are ready to proceed to the main part of the tree!
            </p>
            <p>
             We are happy that you have chosen our Russian course. Just to make it clear, we are using American English in
                                        this course—but don't worry, we will accept all versions of English where appropriate. Just be careful
                                        around expressions like "bathroom" or "1st floor", because these may mean different things than what you are
                                        used to.
            </p>
            <p>
             As for Russian, we teach the standard language, which is based on the variation spoken around Moscow and
                                        Saint Petersburg, and we stick to the usage typical of these cities. Do not worry, though: for more than one
                                        reason Russian is rather uniform over the territory of Russian (still, there is some variation in
                                        pronunciation and a few items of everyday vocabulary). We try to stay neutral in style, with occasional
                                        trips into formal and informal language.
            </p>
            <h3>
             Cases and word order
            </h3>
            <p>
             Russian is an inflected language, so the forms of nouns and modifying adjectives correspond to their role in
                                        the sentence.
            </p>
            <p>
             These forms are called
             <strong>
              cases
             </strong>
             . Russian has 6 cases: Nominative, Accusative, Genitive,
                                        Prepositional, Dative and Instrumental. The Nominative is the dictionary form; as for the others, we are
                                        going to cover them gradually, one by one.
            </p>
            <p>
             This allows for a more loose word order. But not random! A typical word order is
             <em>
              subject—verb—object
             </em>
             .
                                        “Old” information (the things you tell
             <em>
              about
             </em>
             ) is normally closer to the beginning of the sentence
                                        which is probably why pronouns are often found closer to the beginning of a sentence than a noun would be :
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              <em>
               I know him.
              </em>
              → Я
              <strong>
               его́
              </strong>
              зна́ю.
             </li>
             <li>
              <em>
               I know Maria.
              </em>
              → Я зна́ю
              <strong>
               Мари́ю
              </strong>
              .
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             That includes words like “here”, “in this way”, “then” and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
             Unlike English, adverbs are NOT universally grouped at the end. So pay attention to the typical positions for
                                        the expressions of time, place and manner. Eg. “very much” is typically in the end-position in English, but
                                        in Russian it is just before the thing that is "very" or “very much”:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              <em>
               She likes to read
               <strong>
                very much
               </strong>
              </em>
              = Она́
              <strong>
               о́чень
              </strong>
              лю́бит чита́ть
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             Good luck!
            </p>
            <h3>
             Vowel reduction
            </h3>
            <p>
             Like in English, vowel letters aren't
             <em>
              all
             </em>
             pronounced just like in the alphabet. In Russian,
                                        unstressed syllables have vowels
             <em>
              reduced
             </em>
             :
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              <strong>
               А and О
              </strong>
              become the same uh-sound
             </li>
             <li>
              <strong>
               И and Е
              </strong>
              (Э) become the same sound similar to "i" in "hit"
             </li>
             <li>
              <strong>
               Я
              </strong>
              actually becomes an i-like sound, not an uh-like (except in a few words). This also
                                            affects "а" after ч,ш,щ,ж or ц in many words (sadly, not all).
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             So, when a vowel is not stressed, it becomes weaker, somewhat shorter, and also some vowels become
                                        indistinguishable.
            </p>
            <p>
             The unstressed syllable is strongest just before the stress. In all other places it is even weaker than that
                                        (though, some long words, especially compounds, may acquire a secondary stress). This makes the system
                                        different from the English one, where stronger and weaker syllables tend to alternate.
            </p>
            <h3>
             More on the case system
            </h3>
            <p>
             For now, we only study simple sentences that either use the dictionary form, the
             <em>
              Nominative
             </em>
             case, or
                                        use the
             <em>
              Accusative
             </em>
             (direct object of an action), which has the same form for many classes of nouns.
            </p>
            <p>
             The case is defined by its use. Nevertheless, these forms have names, usually calques from Latin that reflect
                                        some typical use (but not the only one):
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              Nominative (subject)
             </li>
             <li>
              Accusative (direct object)
             </li>
             <li>
              Genitive ("of" something)
             </li>
             <li>
              Prepositional (place or topic)
             </li>
             <li>
              Dative (recipient, "indirect" object)
             </li>
             <li>
              Instrumental (means of action)
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             As you can see, these names are of little use until you know what sentence, verb or preposition requires that
                                        you use that particular form.
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              some nouns of foreign origin are
              <em>
               indeclinable
              </em>
              , i.e. all their forms are the same. This includes
                                            words like метро, Дженни or кафе.

                                        so it is implied you or the listener are going to bed soon after).

                                        and other similar expressions are often shortened versions of longer phrases, where words still retain their

             English prefers to express ownership and “possession” with the verb “have”. In Russian “existence” is almost
                                        universally used instead (in the official/academic style «иметь»
             <em>

                                        very fat cat”). This also applies to expressing temporary states and illnesses (“She has a migraine”).

             In English, the only way a verb changes in the present tense is that you add -s for the 3rd person singular.
                                        In Russian, all 6 forms are different and fit two regular patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
             However,
             <strong>
              <em>
               eat
              </em>
             </strong>
             «есть» and
             <strong>
              <em>
               want
              </em>
             </strong>
             «хоте́ть» are two of the
                                        four verbs that are irregular (that is, do not strictly follow any of the 2 patterns).
            </p>
            <p>
             Note that the "present" tense is formed from one stem and the "past" and infinitive from the second one. In
                                        general, these two are slightly different. For now, don't worry about the infinitive stem.

            <h3>
             Hard and soft
            </h3>
            <p>
             Russian consonants are split into two groups of 15, which are pronounced in two different ways,
             <em>
              palatalized
             </em>
             (aka "soft") and
             <em>
              non-palatalized
             </em>
             (aka "hard"). We'll stick to the shorter "soft" and "hard"
                                        (sorry).
            </p>
            <p>
             When a consonant is "soft" it means than you pronounce it with you tongue raised high; for "non-palatalized"
                                        consonants it stays low. Russian orthography has its history but, long story short, you can tell the
                                        "softness" of a consonant from a vowel letter spelled afterwards:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              <strong>
               А, Ы, У, Э, О
              </strong>
              follow "hard" consonants
             </li>
             <li>
              <strong>
               Я, И, Ю, Е, Ё
              </strong>
              follow palatalized ones
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             If there is nothing after a consonant, the soft sign Ь is used to show the softness. In consonant clusters
                                        palatalization is predictable from the softness of the last consonant. We aren't teaching it here. These
                                        days the trend is to only "soften" the last consonant in most clusters, while a hundred years ago some
                                        clusters were palatalized even without any obvious reason.
            </p>
            <p>
             To show you how it works, here is an example, using an ad-hoc transcription:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              же́
              <strong>
               нщ
              </strong>
              ина = [жэнʲщиᵉна]
             </li>
             <li>
              <strong>
               ст
              </strong>
              ена́ = [стʲиᵉна] or [сʲтʲиᵉна]
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             There are dictionaries («орфоэпический словарь») that show the recommended pronunciation of words and contain
                                        general pronunciation rules, too.
            </p>
            <h3>
             Voicing
            </h3>
            <p>
             Some consonants let your voice come out immediately (voiced) while others wait for the release of the
                                        consonant and only then let your voice escape (unvoiced). In Russian there are 6 pairs of such consonants:
                                        Б/П, В/Ф, Г/К, Д/Т, Ж/Ш, З/С.
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              whenever one of these consonants (except В) follows another, the second overrides or reverses the
                                            voicing of the first: сд = [зд], вс= [фс]
             </li>
             <li>
              the end of the phrase is unvoiced: этот клуб
              <em>
               [клуп]
              </em>
             </li>
             <li>
              rules apply between the word boundaries, too
             </li>
             <li>
              Х, Ч, Ц, Щ also play this game, even though Russian lacks letters for their voiced partners ([ɣ], [дж'],
                                            [дз], [ж'ж']). They will devoice the preceding consonant or become voiced themselves.
             </li>
            </ul>
            <h6>
             Unlike Ukrainian, Russian only uses [ɣ], [дж'] and [дз] as voiced variants of х, ч, ц. Ukrainian has them as
                                        full-fledged consonants—the ones that are an intrinsic part of a word and can appear anywhere.

             Russian makes a distinction between
             <strong>
              ты
             </strong>
             , singular "you", and

              вы
             </strong>
             , plural "you" (y'all). The latter also doubles for "polite" you, with verbs also in plural. And don't forget that the "excuse" in "Excuse me" is a verb!

             </li>
             <li>
              People use

             Contrary to what many native speakers have come to believe in the last ten or fifteen years, the polite "you" is not automatically capitalized in Russian, and never was. Such capitalization is used in some formal styles.

             As you might know if you ever read any Russian literature, Russians have three names; their first name and their surname—just like you have—and a
             <em>
              patronymic
             </em>
             (отчество), which is based on their father's name (отец = father). A very common 'polite' pattern is to use a person's first name and a patronymic:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              Ива́н Иванович, вы за́няты? =

            </ul>
            <p>
             In this course,
             <strong>
              name+patronymic
             </strong>
             are always used with the polite
             <strong>
              вы
             </strong>
             -form.

            </h3>
            <p>
             «Как вас зову́т?» is literally "How (do) they call you?"
            </p>
            <p>
             Russian has a casual diminutive form for many common names, : Ива̓н→Ва́ня, Мари́я→Маша, Алекса́ндр(Алекса́ндра)→Са́ша, Евге́ний(Евге́ния)→Же́ня, Еле́на→Ле́на, Алексе́й→Лёша, Пётр→Пе́тя. Needless to say, there's no "politeness" with these, but they are often used with some degree of affection.

             Excuse me...
            </h3>
            <p>
             Russian has two very common polite patterns for questions that English does not:

              <strong>
               negative
              </strong>
              questions give a shade of "by any chance": «Извини́те, вы не зна́ете Михаи́ла?» =
              <em>
               Excuse me, do you happen to know Mikhail?
              </em>
             </li>
             <li>
              <strong>
               "Please tell"
              </strong>
              when asking for information: «Скажи́те, пожа́луйста, где музе́й?» =
              <em>
               Excuse me, where is the museum?

            <p>
             «Спаси́бо»  is the word. A fancier option would be «Благодарю́!» (a form of the verb «благодари́ть», "to thank"), though quite a number of people use it, if only for variety.

             Spelling Rules
            </h3>
            <p>
             Or maybe not. Sometimes Russian forces your choice of vowel to spell or pronounce after a certain letter.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The 7-letter rule
             </strong>
             : Whenever you make any form of a word, and you need to write И or Ы, check this:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              after К, Г, Х  and Ш, Ж, Щ, Ч always use
              <strong>
               И
              </strong>
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             These are velars ("back" consonants) and hushes. For hushes, it is merely a spelling convention, owing to their former "soft" status. For velars, it is true to their pronunciation — i.e., these consonants always use the palatalized И where another consonant would use Ы:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              страна́ → стра́ны
             </li>
             <li>
              строка́ → стро́ки
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             Of these seven consonants, «К» should be your main concern for now. A lot of nouns have it as a suffix or a part of their suffix, forcing you to remember this rule.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The 8-letter rule
             </strong>
             : Whenever you make any form of a word, and you need to write А, У or Я, Ю after a consonant, follow the rule:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              after К, Г, Х , Ш, Ж, Щ, Ч

               and Ц
              </strong>

               А
              </strong>
              or
              <strong>
               У
              </strong>

             Russian words take different forms depending on their role in the sentence. These forms are called
             <strong>
              cases
             </strong>
             . A few forms may look the same (cf. "frequent rains" vs. "It rains often").
            </p>
            <p>
             These forms have names (mostly calques from Latin) that describe some "prototypal" use of such case: Nominative, Accusative, Genitive, Prepositional, Dative and Instrumental. For you, these are just tags: the use is what defines a case.
            </p>
            <p>
             As of now, you know the NOMINATIVE case: the dictionary form of a word. This form acts as the
             <em>
              grammatical subject
             </em>
             of the sentence, the "doer". It is also used for both nouns in "A is B" structure:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              Мой па́па ест.
             </li>
             <li>
              Том — мой брат.
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             You also know a few Genitive forms (у
             <strong>
              меня
             </strong>
             ) but that's it. For now, we will tackle something easier.
            </p>
            <h3>
             Prepositional case
            </h3>
            <p>
             When we talk about things
             <strong>
              <em>
               being
              </em>
             </strong>
             somewhere, we typically use
             <strong>
              в
             </strong>
             (in) or
             <strong>
              на
             </strong>
             (on) with the Prepositional form of the noun. It doesn't work when you mean
             <em>
              motion
             </em>
             to that place!
            </p>
            <p>
             The Prepositional case (a.k.a. Locative) is the only case that is
             <em>
              never
             </em>
             used on its own without a preposition, even though only four or five prepositions ever use it:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              Я на конце́рте. = I am at a concert.
             </li>
             <li>
              Я в шко́ле. = I am at (in) school.
             </li>
             <li>
              ви́део о шко́ле = a video about school
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             Unlike English (“at/in school”), in Russian each "place" is associated with just one preposition. The rough overall rule is: use “в”(in, at) when talking about buildings and places with certain boundaries and use “на” (on, at) when talking about open spaces or events:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              в до́ме
              <em>
               (at home)
              </em>
              , в шко́ле
              <em>
               (at school)
              </em>
              , в ко́мнате
              <em>
               (in the room)
              </em>
              , в теа́тре
              <em>
               (in the theater)
              </em>
              , в кино́
              <em>
               (at the cinema)
              </em>
              , в университе́те
              <em>
               (at the university)
              </em>
             </li>
             <li>
              на ули́це
              <em>
               (in the street, outdoors)
              </em>
              , на пло́щади
              <em>
               (at the square)
              </em>
              , на конце́рте
              <em>
               (at the concert)
              </em>
              , на уро́ке
              <em>
               (at the lesson)
              </em>
              , на кора́бле
              <em>
               (on a ship)
              </em>
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             When you mean physically being inside/on top of some object, there is little ambiguity. "Places", unfortunately, require memorization.

             . In this course, we stick to the North American "bathroom", even though a room with a bath is, technically ва́нная (it has ва́нна, "a bath"). Still, in Russian you would not ask for a "bath-room" unless you really mean it.

            <p>
             Note how plurals of «соба́ка» and «ко́шка» end in И: соба́ки, ко́шки, even though you might expect А to turn into Ы.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are some restrictions on which consonants are used with which vowels when making word forms. Here are the rules for
             <strong>
              и, а, у
             </strong>
             vs.
             <strong>
              ы, я, ю

            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              use only И, not Ы, after
              <strong>
               к, г, х
              </strong>
              /
              <strong>
               ж, ш, щ, ч
              </strong>
             </li>
             <li>
              use only А, У after

              </strong>
              /
              <strong>
               ж, ш, щ, ч

              and
              <strong>
               ц
              </strong>
              (and never use Я, Ю after them)

              К, Г, Х

             are called velar consonants (i.e. made in the back) and
             <em>
              Ш, Щ, Ж, Ч
             </em>
             are often called
             <em>
              hushes
             </em>
             . The latter do not show palatalized/non-palatalized pairs in modern Russian, so the spelling rule does not affect pronunciation anyhow. It's just a convention.

            <p>
             It is not too important for you at the moment, but you may notice how О and Е sometimes appear in consonant clusters or disappear from them. For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              Э́то лев. = This is a lion.
             </li>
             <li>
              В зоопа́рке нет льва́. = There isn't a lion at the zoo.

               Later you will encounter the Genitive plural (often used with numbers and words like "many" or "few"), which shows a simple pattern for

                -к

             <p>
              <em>
               As you can see, the vowel (О or Е) depends on whether the previous consonant is palatalized or not. Hushes behave as if they were palatalzed, despite Ж and Ш having lost this quality in the modern language.

            <p>
             A little side note: some nouns of foreign origin are indeclinable. It means that all their forms are the same. Foreign nouns that end in о/е become like that (кофе, метро, радио, резюме), as well as all nouns that do not fit into Russian declension patterns (see above).
            </p>
            <p>
             This includes female names that end in anything other than А or Я. A few

              -ь
             </strong>
             -ending names are an exception (Любовь and Biblical names like Юдифь).
            </p>
            <p>
             So, all of the following names are automatically indeclinable: Маргарет, Мэри, Элли, Дженни, Рэйчел, Натали, Энн, Ким, Тесс, Жасмин.

             I am away
            </h3>
            <p>
             Russian also uses the Genitive to state that someone is "away", "not there":
             <em>
              Мамы сейчас нет
             </em>
             . In English such use would correspond to "There is no mom at the moment", or even "There is no me now". We are not hard on that particular construction in the course, but it is important to know it all the same.

             Nothing

            <p>
             Russian uses.... let's call it "consistent" negation. It means that in negative sentences you are
             <em>
              required
             </em>
             to use "nothing" instead of "anything", "nowhere" instead of "somewhere" and so on. Let's meet the first of these pronouns:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              У меня
              <strong>
               ничего
              </strong>
              нет. = I don't have anything.
             </li>
             <li>
              Она
              <strong>
               ничего
              </strong>
              не ест. = She doesn't eat anything.
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             You'll also notice that, unlike standard English, Russian has no rule against using double negatives.

             Nouns in Russian belong to one of three genders: feminine, masculine or neuter.  If a noun means a person of a certain gender, use that one. For all other nouns look at the end of the word:

             If there's a soft sign, it isn't possible to predict the gender, at least, not accurately. However, about 65-70% of the most used nouns that end in
             <strong>
              -ь
             </strong>
             are feminine. Also, you can learn the common suffixes ending in a soft sign that produce a word of a predictable gender. They are:

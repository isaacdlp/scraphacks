            Hoş geldiniz! Welcome!
           </h3>
           <p>
            Turkish, unlike many Indo-European languages, contains
            <strong>
             no articles
            </strong>
            at all! Surprisingly simple, right? Turkish does have its own little quirks that will make it a challenge.
           </p>
           <h4>
            Word Order
           </h4>
           <p>
            Turkish is a
            <strong>
             Subject-Object-Verb
            </strong>
            language, meaning that sentences take on a different word order than that of English, French, German, or most other languages that English speakers most commonly study. That being said, a background in Japanese, Korean, or Hungarian will prove very useful.
            <strong>
             The verb always comes at the end
            </strong>
            of the sentence in written Turkish (spoken Turkish allows for some flexibility).
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <em>
              For example:
             </em>
            </strong>
            <strong>
             Ben gazete okurum
            </strong>
            .
            <em>
             Literally
            </em>
            “I newspaper read.”, meaning, “I read newspapers.”
           </p>
           <h4>
            Verb Tenses
           </h4>
           <p>
            The Turkish language does distinguish between a
            <strong>
             “present continuous” and a “simple present” tense
            </strong>
            . In this lesson, we have included the “simple present” form of a few verbs, but this will be taught later in greater detail. This means that there is a difference in the sentences:
           </p>
           <p>
            I eat a sandwich. (present simple)
I am eating a sandwich. (present continuous)
           </p>
           <p>
            Be careful while you are translating, because this does make a difference, just like in English!
           </p>
           <h4>
            Pronouns
           </h4>
           <p>
            The Turkish pronouns are as follows:
           </p>
           <table>
            <thead>
             <tr>
              <th>
              </th>
              <th>
               Singular
              </th>
              <th>
               Plural
              </th>
             </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
             <tr>
              <td>
               1st Person
              </td>
              <td>
               Ben
              </td>
              <td>
               Biz
              </td>
             </tr>
             <tr>
              <td>
               2nd Person
              </td>
              <td>
               Sen
              </td>
              <td>
               Siz
              </td>
             </tr>
             <tr>
              <td>
               3rd Person
              </td>
              <td>
               O
              </td>
              <td>
               Onlar
              </td>
             </tr>
            </tbody>
           </table>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <em>
              Siz
             </em>
            </strong>
            behaves just like
            <strong>
             <em>
              vous
             </em>
            </strong>
            in French, serving both as
            <strong>
             <em>
              you (plural)
             </em>
            </strong>
            and
            <strong>
             <em>
              you (formal)
             </em>
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <h4>
            Articles
           </h4>
           <p>
            There are no articles in Turkish! The number one (bir) is sometimes used to distinguish between the/a(n). However, if a noun is in the subject position, there is no way to tell! Cool, right? This being said, if the noun is in the object position, Turkish does distinguish between the/a(n). In this lesson, we will only use a(n) in the object position, but we will teach you in the Accusative skill how to do it the other way.
           </p>
           <h4>
            Commands
           </h4>
           <p>
            Forming the informal imperative form in Turkish is extremely simple. All you have to do is use the root form of the verb. More information about the formal imperative can be found in the skill “to be.” Here are the two verb in this lesson in their dictionary (infinitive) and informal imperative forms:
           </p>
           <table>
            <thead>
             <tr>
              <th>
               Infinitive
              </th>
              <th>
               English
              </th>
              <th>
               Inf. Imp.
              </th>
              <th>
               English
              </th>
             </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
             <tr>
              <td>
               yemek
              </td>
              <td>
               to eat
              </td>
              <td>
               Ye!
              </td>
              <td>
               Eat!
              </td>
             </tr>
             <tr>
              <td>
               içmek
              </td>
              <td>
               to drink
              </td>
              <td>
               İç!
              </td>
              <td>
               Drink!
              </td>
             </tr>
            </tbody>
           </table>

          <div class="_2f1i5">
           <p>
            Adjectives and all modifiers in Turkish must
            <strong>
             always
            </strong>
            come before the nouns that they modify when they operate as modifiers. This does not stand true if it is used as a predicate adjective with the verb “to be” in English (e.g. The dog is happy). If you use the number
            <em>
             bir
            </em>
            as an article, this will come directly before the noun. For example:
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <em>
              soğuk elma
             </em>
            </strong>
            --The cold apple
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <em>
              soğuk bir elma
             </em>
            </strong>
            -- A cold apple
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <em>
              Elma soğuk
             </em>
            </strong>
            -- The apple is cold.
           </p>
           <p>
            Adjectives are also not declined according to gender and number like what is common to many European languages. This means that adjectives behave pretty close to their English counterparts and shouldn’t pose too big of a challenge.
